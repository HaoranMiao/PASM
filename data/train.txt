WHILE HE BELIEVES THE DOLLAR WILL MOVE LOWER AGAINST THE MAJOR CURRENCIES THE SOFTENING EXPORT MARKET IS PRESSURING JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN EXPORTERS
THESE STOCKS HAVE GONE UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLE IS MUCH HIGHER ABROAD THAN HERE
THAT WOULD MAKE THE NON DOLLAR EQUITY INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE
IT LARGELY REFLECTS BIG AGGRESSIVE EXPORTERS THAT HAVE RESEARCHED AMERICAN MARKETS DESIGNED THEIR OWN PRODUCTS SPENT HEAVILY TO DEVELOP BRAND NAMES AND CONTROLLED THEIR OWN MARKETING
THEY VIEW AMERICAN COMPANIES MOSTLY AS COMPETITORS
COLONEL OCHOA THE U. S. CHANGES ITS POLICY EVERY FOUR YEARS
IT IS NOT A CONSISTENT POLICY LIKE THAT OF THE SOVIET UNION WHICH HAS A SINGLE LINE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD
WITH THE AMERICANS WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND
TODAY THEY ARE OUR ALLIES TOMORROW THEY CAN ABANDON US TO OUR FATE
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HARDLY ACTS AT ALL IT ONLY REACTS TO WHAT WASHINGTON SAYS AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM
IF THE BUY OUT SUCCEEDS *GRANTREE'S* MANAGEMENT IS TO HOLD AN UNDISCLOSED STAKE IN THE COMPANY
THE COMPANY'S BOARD HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS ACCEPT THE BID
IF THE TAKEOVER EFFORT DOESN'T GO THROUGH *GRANTREE* WILL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BE OBLIGED TO PAY THE INVESTOR GROUP ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN BREAK FEES AND EXPENSES
THE CHANGING PERCEPTION OF THE TWO IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN IOWA THE TRADITIONAL OPENING ROUND IN THE HEAVYWEIGHT PRESIDENTIAL CHAMPIONSHIP
IOWA VOTERS CAUCUS TO PICK DELEGATES ON FEBRUARY EIGHTH
A RECENT N. B. C. POLL SHOWS SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF IOWA REPUBLICANS SUPPORT THE TREATY AND ONLY TWELVE PERCENT OPPOSE IT
THE SAME POLL SHOWS SENATOR DOLE RUNNING SIXTEEN POINTS AHEAD OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AMONG REPUBLICANS LIKELY TO ATTEND THE CAUCUSES
WE SAW WITH OIL AND WE'RE SEEING IT WITH GOLD SAYS JOHN DESSAUER AN ORLEANS MASSACHUSETTS MONEY MANAGER

THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD

DRAMS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES ARE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE
OUR SYSTEMS GROUP USES THEM ALONG WITH OUR OWN MICROPROCESSORS TO BUILD MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS
EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER U. S. MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO
TODAY A U. S. DRAM IS PRACTICALLY AN EXTINCT SPECIES
IRAQ SAID ITS WARPLANES ATTACKED A PANAMANIAN FLAG FREIGHTER SETTING IT ABLAZE AND ADRIFT IN THE NORTHERN PERSIAN GULF

T. P. A. REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENT DEATHS BY FIFTY ONE PERCENT IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER HEART ATTACK
OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS WHO WERE GIVEN T. P. A. TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DIED IN THAT PERIOD
OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
THEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HOW CORPORATE DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO ACT
IN BRITAIN DIRECTORS' LEGAL DUTY IS TO SHAREHOLDERS DUTCH LAW OBLIGATES DIRECTORS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCLUDING EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND CREDITORS
DUTCH LAW IS SO HOSTILE TO UNFRIENDLY BIDS THAT NONE HAS SUCCEEDED THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY
SO SO
THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM A LITTLE HARDER
LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE

WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL <NOISE> THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS

THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT THE U. S. BORDER

LOST WAGES SOME ECONOMISTS ARE DISMAYED AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO DROP THE HOURLY EARNINGS INDEX FROM ITS MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT NEXT YEAR
IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAID MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES

ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS A WEEK
IT IS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. TREASURY BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VALIDITY
THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VALIDITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VALIDITY
THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY UP AND ARE NOW BUYING THEIR OWN HOMES AND IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING
THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STABILITY OF THE ECONOMY ABHOR VIOLENCE AND ARE USUALLY PRO U. S.
FURTHER THE HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE SUPERB
I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE NOT JUST IN THE MAJOR CITIES BUT ALSO IN AREAS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED RISKY
THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES
GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX
THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PILE UP GREAT DEFICITS BUT THE BUDGET SUMMIT COMPROMISE OF LAST AUTUMN HARDLY CUTS ANYTHING AT ALL
SOVIET INFLUENCE IN NICARAGUA THREATENS U. S. SECURITY BUT THE U. S. HOUSE ENGAGES IN A PITCHED BATTLE OVER EVEN SCRAPS OF MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE CONTRAS
I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
THE STANDOFF CASTS DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
IT ALSO COULD STYMIE A NEW NEGOTIATING APPROACH IN WHICH THE INDUSTRIES NOT THE GOVERNMENTS IRON OUT TRADE DISPUTES
THAT COULD DRIVE AMERICAN CHIP MAKERS TO ASK THE U. S. GOVERNMENT FOR MORE PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST JAPAN
DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF LP ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION

SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER

IT IS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. T. BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VOLATILITY
THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VOLATILITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY
THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES

THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT

MR. BERG CONTENDS THAT INVESTORS SHOULD BE DIVING INTO STOCKS PICKING UP EASY PROFITS IN THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS

ANALYSTS SAID THE PROXY FIGHT DEFEAT DEALS A BODY BLOW TO BANK OF NEW YORK'S BID
JAMES J. MCDERMOTT JUNIOR DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR KEEFE BRUYETTE AND WOODS INCORPORATED SAID THIS EFFECTIVELY PUTS THE DEAL OUT TO PASTURE

DESPITE YESTERDAY'S DROP ACCORDING TO JUDY GANES AN ANALYST FOR SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON NEW YORK BULLISH FUNDAMENTALS FOR SUGAR REMAIN UNCHANGED
DEMAND FOR SUGAR IS INCREASING BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND WORLD WIDE MS. GANES SAID
SUGAR STOCKS IN EXPORTING COUNTRIES HAVE DROPPED TO A POINT THAT UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN DEMAND MAY NOT BE MET
ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
THE BILL WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE ENACTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALSO WOULD PREVENT STATES FROM SETTING OTHER CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

WHAT TRIGGERED G. M.'S NEW STRATEGY ISN'T CLEAR
WHILE G. M. APPARENTLY HAS DECIDED THAT ITS INCREASINGLY GENEROUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAD GOTTEN PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE CUTTING PRODUCTION IS COSTLY TOO
THE HIGH FIXED COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES SURELY WILL DEPRESS G. M.'S FIRST QUARTER PROFIT
EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE USER FEES

BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
MOODY'S SAID BRAZIL HAD DETERIORATED DRASTICALLY POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS

WHEN THE CHINESE PRESS IN TIBET RESPONDED BY SAVAGELY ATTACKING BOTH THE PRO INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT AND THE DALAI LAMA HIMSELF THE MONKS WERE MOVED TO ACTION

I SENT IN SIX CARDS MYSELF THE PILOT SAID INCLUDING SOME INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT TAKEOFF POWER BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS
BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM
ANOTHER EASTERN PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE MR. BURNLEY'S CRITICISM HE CONSIDERED THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS
INOPERATIVE ITEMS THAT ONCE PERSISTED FOR WEEKS ARE BEING REPAIRED MORE CONSISTENTLY HE SAID
THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS

BOND TRADERS ALSO WERE CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS
THE DROP HAS INDICATED TO SOME ANALYSTS THAT INFLATION FEARS WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
PREVIOUSLY OIL PRICES HAD SURGED ABOVE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL LARGELY ON FEAR THAT GROWING TENSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF MIGHT LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES
IF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS

LOST WAGES SOME ECONOMISTS ARE DISMAYED AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO DROP THE HOURLY EARNINGS INDEX FROM ITS MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT NEXT YEAR
IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAID MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES

INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
MR. FORBES ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME
HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS
IN EFFECT THEY ALREADY ARE OPERATING AS IF IN A RECESSION SO LAYOFFS MIGHT PROVE RELATIVELY MODEST
IN ADDITION THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURING IN THE ECONOMY HAS FADED IN COMPARISON WITH THE GROWTH OF RECESSION RESISTANT SERVICE JOBS
IN MOST MODERN NATIONS IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY WHEN CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE
NOR IS IT SUBVERSIVE TO EMBARRASS THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
SAD TO SAY IN SINGAPORE THIS SEEMS REASON ENOUGH TO INVOKE THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT
WITH EVERY NEW BOUT OF GOVERNMENT PANIC IT BECOMES CLEARER THAT THE REAL FOREIGN ELEMENTS MR. LEE FEARS ARE HIS CRITICS IN SINGAPORE
MANY LAWMAKERS BELIEVE IT IS THEIR DUTY TO BRING HOME THE BACON AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHY ANYONE WOULD THINK OTHERWISE

<NOISE> EARLIER THIS WEEK DEFENSE SECRETARY CASPAR WEINBERGER TOLD REPORTERS AT A BREAKFAST MEETING THAT THE B. ONE'S PROBLEMS WEREN'T SERIOUS
THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW PLANES HE SAID
THE B. ONE HOWEVER IS A VERY GOOD BOMBER
WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF REPORTED STOCK *ASSETS* THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS CONTROL A SIZABLE CHUNK OF PENSION ASSETS AND PRIVATE PORTFOLIOS
INVESTMENT *ADVISERS* TEND TO BE SMALL PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHOSE OWNERS MANAGE THE PORTFOLIOS <NOISE>
THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR A MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES
BUYING CORPORATE ZEROS FOR AN I. R. A. NEUTRALIZES THEIR MOST OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE THE TAX TREATMENT
WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST
THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED
IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN
AFTER MUCH CONFLICT SECRETARY OF STATE CYRUS VANCE STRUCK A DEAL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
EACH EMBASSY COMPLEX HAD TO BE OCCUPIED SIMULTANEOUSLY
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET UNION'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY WAS COMPLETED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BEFORE WORK ON THE U. S.'S NEW MOSCOW EMBASSY HAD EVEN STARTED
THE SOVIETS THEN PUSHED TO OCCUPY THEIR NEW SITE BUT THE U. S. RESISTED UNTIL ITS OWN BUILDINGS WERE READY
AS THE U. S. BUILDINGS WERE COMPLETED IN MOSCOW THE SOVIETS WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THEIR NEW FACILITIES ON MOUNT ALTO
ONLY THE MAIN AMBASSADORIAL BUILDING AT EACH SITE ARE VACANT
MR. BEGEL SAID PULLMAN WILL FINANCE THE PURCHASE THROUGH ITS EXISTING CREDIT LINES
ALSO PULLMAN HAS ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH HE SAID
PULLMAN EARNED SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ON *REVENUE* OF FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
THE RECAPITALIZATION WAS PROPOSED TO THWART A TAKEOVER EFFORT BY BRITISH PRINTING AND COMMUNICATION CORPORATION
THE OXFORD ENGLAND PUBLISHING AND PRINTING CONCERN CONTROLLED BY ROBERT MAXWELL FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK TO BLOCK THE RECAPITALIZATION
A COURT VICTORY WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR MR. MAXWELL TO MAKE A NEW OFFER FOR HARCOURT
<NOISE> CAPTAIN OVERHEARING THE RADIO DISCUSSION ABOUT RUNWAY OH FIVE I UNDERSTOOD NOTHING
AND WHAT RUNWAY
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
<NOISE> STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING *REGULATORS* WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
<NOISE> MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
THEN SECRETARY HAIG TOOK HIS PLAN TO THE WHITE HOUSE
<NOISE> HE INSISTED THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT MUST CONTROL THE POLICY AND EVEN ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO ORDER THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO SUPPLY PERSONNEL TO HELP PLAN DETAILS
THE IDEA WAS REJECTED
NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY *RESTRUCTURING* CANDIDATE
ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS
BUT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVING BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ASSET VALUES HAVE CHANGED THAT
<NOISE> A SOUTH KOREAN AIRLINER VANISHED SOMEWHERE NEAR BURMA AND APPARENTLY CRASHED INTO THE SEA OR THICK JUNGLE OFFICIALS IN SEOUL SAID
THE KOREAN AIR JET WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE ABROAD WAS EN ROUTE TO SEOUL FROM BAGHDAD WHEN AVIATION OFFICIALS LOST CONTACT WITH THE PLANE
K. A. L. OFFICIALS WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HIJACKING OR SABOTAGE
BUT OTHERS NOTABLY WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISERS PRESSED ON
WE FELT THAT THE FUTURES MARKET REFLECTED ACTUAL TRADING LEVELS AT THE TIME SAYS FRED GRAUER THE HEAD OF WELLS FARGO AND COMPANY SUBSIDIARY
MANY STOCK PRICES HADN'T BEEN UPDATED IN SEVERAL MINUTES HE EXPLAINS AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT SUBSEQUENT STOCK TRADES WOULD BE AT EVEN LOWER LEVELS
BY DAY'S END WELLS SOLD FOURTEEN THOUSAND FUTURES CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS
EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT LANDED AT A NEARBY AIRPORT
BUT THE TERMINAL FACILITIES WERE CLOSED SO MR. BARRETT AND FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS HAD TO SCALE A WIRE FENCE TO GET OUT
A NEARBY HOTEL PICKED THEM UP AND CHARGED THEM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS EACH FOR THE VAN RIDE
NACCO MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A FRAGMENTED PORTABLE APPLIANCE INDUSTRY IS UNDERGOING A CONSOLIDATION AND NACCO WANTS TO BE A PLAYER IN THAT PROCESS MR. SMITH SAID
WE WOULDN'T HAVE ACQUIRED WEAREVER PROCTORSILEX IF THERE WEREN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD TO IT HE SAID
ELECTRIC APPLIANCES ARE THE LARGEST PART OF THAT BUSINESS HE SAID
<NOISE> TODAY THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY IS ON THE ROPES WITH SALES PLUMMETING NINETY SEVEN PERCENT IN A SINGLE YEAR
THIS ILLUSTRATES THE SAD TRUTH THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE OVERNIGHT IN THE STOCK MARKET
LIKE SAY THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
LAST YEAR SPONSORS OF A STRONG ACID RAIN BILL CLAIMED TO HAVE A TENTATIVE ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR OF THEIR BILL
THE MEASURE WAS CO SPONSORED BY ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSE AND SUPPORT APPEARED TO BE GROWING
REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL WHOSE DISTRICT'S STEEL AND AUTO INDUSTRIES OPPOSED THE BILL BOTTLED IT UP IN THE COMMITTEE
<NOISE> GORBACHEV DISCUSSED ARMS CONTROL ISSUES WITH OTHER WARSAW PACT LEADERS IN EAST BERLIN
WHILE DETAILS WEREN'T DISCLOSED SOVIET OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO UNILATERAL WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET TROOPS FROM EASTERN EUROPE
SPOKESMEN SAID THERE WOULD BE NO REPORT ON THE CONFERENCE BEFORE ITS CONCLUSION SCHEDULED FOR TODAY
THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
BUT THE INCIDENT WASN'T REPORTED
AS MR. MCGOWAN REMEMBERS IT THE UNITED CAPTAIN WHO NORMALLY FILES SUCH REPORTS SIMPLY SAID LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT
IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE
MR. KAPLAN JOINED *MACMILLAN* IN NINETEEN SIXTY WHEN A COMPANY HE CO FOUNDED THE FREE PRESS WAS SOLD TO THE PUBLISHER
HE BECAME PRESIDENT OF MACMILLAN PUBLISHING IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND WAS NAMED MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY'S BRITISH SUBSIDIARY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR
HE REASSUMED THE POST OF PRESIDENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
<NOISE> SECURITIES ANALYSTS HOWEVER REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT BASIC LOAN DEMAND
BRENT ERENSEL OF DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED NOTED LENDING VOLUME GENERALLY ISN'T ROBUST
MARGINS ARE DOWN BECAUSE OF THE NEW TAX LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS IN BRAZIL
ON THE OTHER HAND HE *SAID* LOAN PORTFOLIO QUALITY IS IMPROVING AND BANKS ARE GETTING A BETTER GRIP ON CONTROLLING EXPENSES
MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
MR. KITAJIMA GETS EXCITED
HE PREDICTS A BIG GAIN IN THE INDEX MAYBE A THOUSAND POINTS
IT'S JUST A FEELING I HAVE HE SAYS
WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAYS FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED
AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D JUST SIT BACK AND JUST ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS SAID EDWARD P. NICOSKI MARKET STRATEGIST AT PIPER JAFFRAY AND HOPWOOD INCORPORATED MINNEAPOLIS
<NOISE> BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME STRONG BUYING HERE
WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS BREAKING OUT OF THEIR TRADING RANGES
IN AN AWKWARD REMINDER OF THE BOOM DAYS SHEARSON'S NEW LONDON HEADQUARTERS FACES AN ICE SKATING RINK BUILT JUST TO GIVE THE COMPLEX MORE GRANDEUR
OUTDOOR ORGAN MUSIC BLARES LAWRENCE WELK TUNES ONE DAY AS TWO BOYS SKATE ALONE ON THE ICE WITH HOCKEY STICKS
IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT A SHEARSON OFFICIAL BITTERLY REMARKS
UNDERNEATH THE SKATING RINK IS A GYMNASIUM SHEARSON IS TRYING TO SELL
MR. LICHTEN DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
HOWEVER BANK EXECUTIVES SPECULATE THAT HIS DEPARTURE WAS LINKED TO CHASE'S MERGER LAST DECEMBER OF ITS INVESTMENT BANKING AND COMMERCIAL BANKING FUNCTIONS
FOLLOWING THE REORGANIZATION MR. LICHTEN BECAME EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR TAX RELATED FINANCINGS AND FOREIGN CORPORATE CLIENTS
THE FED'S POSTURE THROUGH ALL OF THIS IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE WILLIAM MCCHESNEY MARTIN FED OF THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES
<NOISE> THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION ABOUT MR. MARTIN'S PRIORITIES HE WAS FIRST OF ALL AN INFLATION FIGHTER AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY TO THE GOOD
BUT NO ONE WAS EVER SURE JUST HOW THE FED WOULD WAGE ITS INFLATION BATTLES
MR. MARTIN INDICATED HE WOULD LEAN AGAINST THE WIND WHEN HE SENSED INFLATION COMING AND IT DID
HE GOT RID OF THE INFLATION SURGE THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BUT IT TOOK THE DEEP NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT RECESSION TO DO SO
<NOISE> THIS IS THE POOREST LAND IN THE WEST BESET BY CORRUPTION ILLITERACY DISEASE AND A HISTORY OF GOVERNMENTS THAT SEEMINGLY HAVE MADE THOSE CONDITIONS POLICY GOALS
<NOISE> HAITI'S PROBLEMS AND PECULIARITIES NOW SEEM TO B- SO TOWERING THAT THE LATEST POLITICAL TWISTS PROBABLY WON'T MEAN MUCH
WESTERN NOTIONS OF PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT FADE IN THE SMOKE OF A VOODOO PRIEST'S FLAMING MAGIC STONES
SCHERING PLOUGH SAID GRUPO ACHE HAS AN OPTION TO BUY THE REST
THE BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS BASED IN RIO DE JANEIRO INCLUDE A PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING PLANT AND OFFICES THAT EMPLOY ABOUT NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE
SCHERING PLOUGH SAID GRUPO ACHE WOULD INSTALL ITS OWN MANAGEMENT
<NOISE> THE BRAZILIAN FACILITY HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS
CITICORP ATTRIBUTED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PROJECT WHICH FOCUSED ON OIL AND *PETROCHEMICALS* TO THE SHARP DECLINE OF OIL PRICES IN THE PAST YEAR
A CITICORP SPOKESMAN SAID CURTAILMENTS IN TRADING OPERATIONS AT MAJOR OIL COMPANIES AND THE DROP OF THE DOLLAR VOLUME OF OIL TRADING HURT THE DEMAND FOR THE SERVICE
GEMCO HAD HOPED EVENTUALLY TO EXPAND THE BUSINESS TO INCLUDE OTHER COMMODITIES BUT THOSE PLANS HAVE BEEN DROPPED
UNDER THE PLAN EXISTING HOLDERS WHO OWNED THREE POINT THREE MILLION COMMON SHARES WILL OWN ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE COMMON IN THE REORGANIZED COMPANY
THE PLAN CALLS FOR MR. WILLIAMS TO RECEIVE A BONUS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES AND OPTIONS TO BUY ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD
SOME SHARES WILL BE RESERVED FOR OTHER SALANT OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES
IF ALL OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED MR. WILLIAMS WOULD HOLD NINE POINT FOUR TWO PERCENT INTEREST IN THE COMPANY
THEY ARE FIRMLY BASED ON THREE PRINCIPLES
<NOISE> THE FIRST IS THAT TRUST AND FREEDOM SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER REGULATION AND *BUREAUCRATIC* CONTROL
IF PEOPLE AT EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE AUTHORITY CO- COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR DUTIES THEY QUICKLY LOSE THEIR MOTIVATION AND THEIR SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
TO CHANGE SUCH THINKING FORD HAS RECENTLY BEGUN CIRCULATING NEW SALARY GUIDELINES
WE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE STAFF IN CONSIDERING SALARIES SAYS MR. HAUSMAN
THE AUTO MAKER HAS ALSO DONE AWAY WITH COST OF LIVING AND GENERAL SALARY INCREASES IN FAVOR OF MERIT RAISES TO PROMOTE PRODUCTIVITY
FUJITSU LIMITED'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF FIVE YEAR EUROBONDS WITH THE SAME BASIC TERMS CLOSED AT NINETY EIGHT TO NINETY NINE
THE JAPANESE ELECTRONICS CONCERN IS AFFECTED BY THE U. S.'S NEWLY IMPOSED DUTIES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL AT NIKKO SECURITIES COMPANY WHICH LED THE ISSUE
BUT IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW LARGE THE IMPACT WILL BE
A CONRAIL ENGINEER WAS INDICTED ON CHARGES OF MANSLAUGHTER IN CONNECTION WITH THE JANUARY FOURTH COLLISION OF THREE LOCOMOTIVES WITH AN AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN IN MARYLAND
SIXTEEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE INJURED IN THE CRASH
A GRAND JURY FOUND THAT THE ENGINEER HAD OPERATED THE LOCOMOTIVES IN A GROSSLY NEG- NEGLIGENT MANNER
<NOISE> POLAROID STILL MUST REFINE THESE TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE THEY CAN BE USED IN MAJOR CONSUMER SYSTEMS
INITIAL HIGH PRICED COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS USING THE TECHNOLOGIES MUST BE AVAILABLE BY NINETEEN NINETY BUT CONSUMER SYSTEMS WILL TAKE LONGER
MOREOVER ANY NEW SYSTEM THAT POLAROID BRINGS TO MARKET ISN'T GUARANTEED SUCCESS BECAUSE OTHER CAMERA COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON ELECTRONIC IMAGING SYSTEMS AS WELL
ISRAEL'S SHAMIR HOPES TO AVOID LOOKING LIKE THE SPOILER OF PEACE PROSPECTS BY FLOATING A REGIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE PLAN INVOLVING ONLY ISRAEL AND ARAB STATES
HE BILLS IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RIVAL PERES'S PLANS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING LEADING TO ISRAEL JORDAN TALKS
BUT JORDAN AND THE PALESTINIANS BOTH FIND SHAMIR'S PLAN UNACCEPTABLE
SECOND THERE WAS MR. KINNOCK HIMSELF
<NOISE> HIS STRATEGIES AND POLL TAKERS HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT MOST BRITISH VOTERS ONLY HAVE A FUZZY IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS
PART OF HIS PROBLEM WAS MRS. THATCHER WHOSE POWERFUL PERSONALITY HAS DOMINATED THE STAGE FOR ALMOST A DECADE
PEOPLE GENERALLY RESPECT MRS. THATCHER BUT NOT MANY REALLY LIKE HER
THE COMPANY ATTRIBUTED THE EARNINGS INCREASE TO GROWING POPULARITY OF ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH IS USED WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINE CORP.'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND COMPATIBLE MODELS
THE COMPANY ALSO SAID INITIAL ORDERS FOR ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM FOR APPLE COMPUTER INCORPORATED MACINTOSH HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING
THE SYSTEM FOR THE MACINTOSH WAS INTRODUCED IN AUGUST
THE PROMOTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MR. RICE PREDICTS
THE DISCOUNTING IS LIKELY TO BE PARTICULARLY SHARP THIS MONTH AND NEXT A PERIOD DUBBED DEATH VALLEY DAYS IN THE BUSINESS BECAUSE SALES ARE USUALLY SO SLOW
DOMINO'S THIS MONTH BEGAN ITS FIRST NATIONAL AD CAMPAIGN FOR A TWO FOR ONE OFFER
MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN HIGHLY SURPRISED BY MR. JACKSON'S HISTORIC VICTORIES ON SUPER TUESDAY
THOUGH MANY POLLS ACCURATELY RECORDED HIS GROWING STRENGTH THE NEWS STORIES ACCOMPANYING THESE POLLS HAD THE USUAL IMMENSE DIFFICULTY IN MENTIONING THE DIFFICULT NAME OF JACKSON
THIS WAS TRUE IN THE CASE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON POST
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OLDER OR LARGER BUSINESSES THINK GEORGE BUSH'S POLICY WOULD BE THE MOST FAVORABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS
BUT THE VICE PRESIDENT HARDLY WON A RINGING ENDORSEMENT HE RATED ONLY FIVE POINT EIGHT ON A SCALE OF TEN
AND AMONG WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS MR. BUSH HAD ONLY A FOUR POINT EIGHT RATING
KODAK MAKES A BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY MOSTLY FOR ITSELF
IT SELLS ABOUT TWO MILLION POUNDS TO SIX U. S. DISTRIBUTORS WHO RESELL TO OTHERS
KODAK KNOWS THE IDENTITY OF THE END USERS OF ONE MILLION POUNDS BUT CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE REST
HOECHST CELANESE SELLS ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TO DOZENS OF DISTRIBUTORS A SPOKESMAN SAYS
IN SOME INSTANCES WE KNOW WHO THE DISTRIBUTOR SELLS TO THE SPOKESMAN SAYS
IN SOME CASES WE DON'T
AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK
BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS LUCRATIVE FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA
BRITISH AIRWAYS GAVE UP ONLY A FEW ROUTES FROM GATWICK TO EUROPEAN CITIES WHICH IN MOST CASES IS ALREADY SERVED FROM HEATHROW
TRADERS SAID INVESTORS APPARENTLY WERE SKITTISH ABOUT BUYING THE KROGER PREFERRED AFTER THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS TO RESTRUCTURE
TRADERS SAID THE COMPANY WILL NOW PAY ITS DUTCH AUCTION PREFERRED HOLDERS EIGHT POINT NINE ONE PERCENT OVER THE NEXT FORTY NINE DAYS UNTIL THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED AUCTION
THAT RATE IS MORE THAN TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER PREFERRED DIVIDENDS BY SIMILAR SINGLE A. RATED COMPANIES
LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
CHICAGO MAGAZINE HAS ANNUAL REVENUE OF ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IS OPERATING AT ABOUT BREAK EVEN METROPOLITAN DETROIT OFFICIALS SAID
BUT THEY SAID THEY EXPECT TO TRIM COSTS BY COMBINING BOTH MAGAZINES' PAPER AND PRINTING EXPENSES
CHICAGO MAGAZINE STILL HASN'T HIT ITS STRIDE SAID TOM JONES PUBLISHER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF METROPOLITAN DETROIT
THERE'S TREMENDOUS ROOM TO GROW IN TERMS OF AD PAGES
CONTRA LEADERS SAY THEY LOOK FORWARD TO THE MILITARY CHALLENGE
IT'S IN OUR BALLPARK SAYS CARLOS ULVERT THE CONTRA FOREIGN SECRETARY
HE AND OTHER CONTRAS ASSERT THAT CONGRESSIONAL STINGINESS UNTIL THIS YEAR KEPT THE CONTRAS FROM PICKING UP STEAM ON THE BATTLEFIELD
<NOISE> MR. ULVERT ADDS IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TEN THOUSAND MEN IN NICARAGUA BETTER TRAINED AND BETTER SUPPLIED THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE IS GOING TO BE FELT
THAT LINE MAY BE WEARING THIN WITH PRIVATE BANKS
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF SOUND POLICY MOVES
OTHERWISE WHY KEEP POURING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD
AT W. F. I. A. RUNNING THE FORMULA LAST JANUARY THIRTIETH MEANT BUYING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF REEBOK QUICKLY
THAT'S BECAUSE W. F. I. A. LIKES TO OWN ALL THE STOCKS IN THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED INDEX IN AMOUNTS SCALED TO THEIR MARKET WEIGHT
THOSE HOLDINGS RANGE FROM MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF I. B. M. TO JUST SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ALLIS CHALMERS CORPORATION
HIS FIRST TEST ON THAT ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER HE CAN PERSUADE THE OPPOSITION TO FIELD A CANDIDATE AGAINST HIM
THE CHIEF OPPOSITION PARTY THE REUNIFICATION AND DEMOCRACY PARTY LED BY KIM YOUNG SAM HAS VOWED IT WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION
IT AND THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION A NEWLY FORMED ALLIANCE OF RELIGIOUS AND DISSIDENT GROUPS ARE ORGANIZING TOMORROW'S OPPOSITION RALLIES
SOUNDS GOOD BUT WHAT'S THE CATCH
MR. LEMING A CHEMICALS ANALYST ISSUED HIS REPORT JUNE TWENTY SECOND WITH SEAGRAM TRADING AT SEVENTY SEVEN
IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTY SIX AND THREE EIGHTHS UP ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
THIS REASONING HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO GALVANIZE THE MARKET
MR. LEMING DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT YESTERDAY
GEMFIBROZIL HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO INCREASE H. D. L. BUT UNTIL THIS REPORT ITS EFFECT ON HEART DISEASE WAS UNCLEAR
AVAILABLE IN THE U. S. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO GEMFIBROZIL GAINED ONLY LIMITED USE
THAT IS BECAUSE GEMFIBROZIL ONLY MODERATELY REDUCES L. D. L. COMPARED WITH OTHER DRUGS
THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
THE WINNER IN THE GENERAL ELECTION USED SOME CREATIVE METHODS TOO
RONALD REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN REGISTERED VOTERS FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN USING TWO MILLION DOLLARS CHARGED TO HIS UNCONTESTED RENOMINATION
THE STAFF OF THE ELECTION COMMISSION CHALLENGED THAT AND RECOMMENDED THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BE REPAID TO THE TREASURY
BUT THE AUDITORS WERE OVERRULED BY A FOUR TO ONE VOTE OF THE COMMISSION IN WHICH ALL REPUBLICAN MEMBERS SIDED WITH THE PRESIDENT
AS SOON AS TWO MONTHS FROM NOW ARGENTINE COURTS ARE DUE TO TRY THE LAST GROUPS OF GENERALS STILL SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION FOR ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
THE PROCEEDINGS ARE THE LAST CHANCE TO BRING MILITARY MEN TO CIVILIAN JUSTICE
SO FAR IN FOUR YEARS OF CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SEVEN TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED
CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST HUNDREDS OF OTHERS BUT PROSECUTIONS WERE HALTED LAST YEAR IN THE FACE OF ARMY RESTIVENESS
THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT THE ACCUSED OFFICERS HAD ONLY BEEN ACTING UNDER ORDERS
KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
<NOISE> IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
REMEMBER THE ONE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BANKER
IT WAS WIDELY TOLD CIRCA OCTOBER NINETEENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND WENT LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU CALL AN INVESTMENT BANKER
HEY WAITER
NOW STUNG BY THE RECENT DEBT LADEN TAKEOVERS SOME FUND MANAGERS ARE PLANNING TO DUMP INDUSTRIAL BONDS
OTHERS WILL REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO THEM
WHAT MEN ARE BUYING INSTEAD BONDS ISSUED BY UTILITIES BANKS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES THOSE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF BEING BOUGHT OUT
OTHERS ARE BUYING SAFER TREASURY BONDS WHOSE YIELDS ARE A PERCENTAGE OR LESS BELOW TOP GRADE INDUSTRIAL DEBT
ALONG WITH THAT SURGE HAS COME AN EXPLOSION OF ANOTHER SORT
THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND INQUIRIES WE'RE GETTING IS ENORMOUS SAYS CECELIA CHARLES ACTING DIRECTOR OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS FOR THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
THEY'RE INCREASING BETWEEN FIVE PERCENT AND TEN PERCENT A YEAR
THERE WILL BE ABOUT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND OF THEM THIS YEAR
DELTA IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT WILL BECOME THE NEW OFFICIAL CARRIER FOR WALT DISNEY WORLD IN ORLANDO FLORIDA
THE AIRLINE IS CALLING TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MARKETING ENDEAVOR IN DELTA'S RECENT HISTORY
FOR RIVAL EASTERN AIRLINES A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION IT MAY BE YET ANOTHER LOSS OF PRESTIGE
UNDER THE PLAN EXISTING HOLDERS WHO OWNED THREE POINT THREE MILLION COMMON SHARES WILL OWN ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE COMMON IN THE REORGANIZED COMPANY
THE PLAN CALLS FOR MR. WILLIAMS TO RECEIVE A BONUS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES AND OPTIONS TO BUY ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD
SOME SHARES WILL BE RESERVED FOR OTHER SALANT OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES
IF ALL OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED MR. WILLIAMS WOULD HOLD A NINE POINT FOUR TWO PERCENT INTEREST IN THE COMPANY
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
ALSO PROVIDING SOME SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS
THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS
THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS
I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
WE NEED A NEW NATIONAL POLICY ON THE ROLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SHOULD PLAY IN OUR SOCIETY
OUR CURRENT POLICY IS STILL BASED ON THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR FRAMED WHEN THE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER WAS STILL A DREAM
THE ACT PROVIDED THE IMPETUS FOR ACHIEVING THE OVERRIDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS OBJECTIVE OF THAT TIME UNIVERSAL SERVICE

FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY FEDERAL POLICY HAS SAPPED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORLD'S STRONGEST AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY

IN ADDITION N. C. R. IS REPURCHASING ITS OWN SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET MR. EXLEY SAID

THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP ZERO POINT FIVE EIGHT CENT TO SIXTY POINT THREE SIX CENTS A POUND

THIS PLAN DUBBED THE MIYAZAWA PLAN IN HONOR OF JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA SOUNDS JOLLY ON THE SURFACE
BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES

BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN A. INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL

MANY TRADERS ASSUME THE FINANCING WILL CONSIST OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
BUT SOME TRADERS SAY THEY AREN'T SO SURE THERE WILL BE ANY THIRTY YEAR BONDS
THE REASON PRESIDENT REAGAN HASN'T YET SIGNED A TAX BILL WITH A PROVISION THAT WOULD INCREASE THE GOVERMENT'S LONG TERM BOND ISSUANCE AUTHORITY

AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE S- UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
<NOISE> SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO

THE MINING WAS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF COVERT ACTIVITY ADVANCING NATIONAL SECURITY GOALS SECRETLY
<NOISE> THE CORINTO MINING HAD A SENSIBLE U. S. SECURITY OBJECTIVE CURTAILING THE SHIPMENT OF SOVIET BLOC ARMS TO CENTRAL AMERICA THROUGH THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA
THE EXISTENCE OF THE OPERATION LEAKED OUT AND ONCE EXPOSED DETAILS FLOWED FREELY FROM CONGRESS
THE ACTIVITY ENDED
THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT UNIQUE
OPPONENTS OF COVERT ACTIVITY HAVE DISCOVERED THAT BY LEAKING COVERT OPERATIONS INTO THE NEWS THEY CAN CREATE A DEBILITATING AURA OF SUSPICION AND ILLEGITIMACY AROUND FOREIGN POLICIES THEY DISLIKE

PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX QUARTERS BENEFITED FROM THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GOOD WILL AMORTIZATION IN EACH PERIOD
THE GOOD WILL AMORTIZATION REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT ABOVE BOOK VALUE THAT G. M. PAID FOR HUGHES AIRCRAFT
THAT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS A CHARGE AGAINST G. M.'S EARNINGS
BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
<NOISE> THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT
PREVIOUSLY THE RIGHTS OR POISON PILL WERE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY ONLY IF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STOCK WERE IN HOSTILE HANDS

<NOISE> HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
THE BIG ATTRACTION IS THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SUMMER OLYMPICS AREN'T REALLY BEING HELD IN THE SUMMER

IT ALSO HOPES THE GAMES WILL ATTRACT UPSCALE VIEWERS WHO NORMALLY DON'T TUNE INTO SPORTS
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
<NOISE> BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OCCASIONALLY MOUTHED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PRIVATE EXPRESS STATUTES THE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT FREE CHOICE IN MAIL SERVICE BUT HAS DONE LITTLE ASIDE FROM TALK
THE WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED EARLIER LAST YEAR TO STOP THE POSTAL SERVICE FROM BANNING PRIVATE COMPANIES FROM SHIPPING BUNDLES OF LETTERS OVERSEAS TO BE DEPOSITED DIRECTLY IN FOREIGN MAIL SYSTEMS
BUT THIS WAS FAIRLY MINOR
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH "DOUBLE-QUOTE NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION "DOUBLE-QUOTE THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
BY NOW THERE IS LITTLE ELSE MR. FALCIGNO CAN DO TO HYPE ATTENDANCE

ANALYST THOMAS ROONEY OF DONALDSON LUFKIN AND JENRETTE GOT SCORES OF CALLS FROM CLIENTS ABOUT THE RUMORS
HE ESTIMATES PRIME'S DOMESTIC BUSINESS MAY BE OFF TWENTY PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WITH FOREIGN SALES UP BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
DOMESTIC SALES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF PRIME'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REVENUE
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES

SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING

AND MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE EARNINGS GROWTH TO CONTINUE ALBEIT AT A MORE MODEST RATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET
TO GET AROUND THAT REQUIREMENT INSURERS CAN PAY A REINSURER TO ASSUME PART OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THE ANNUITY IN RETURN FOR PART OF THE PREMIUM
BUT MOST REINSURANCE CONTRACTS DON'T TRANSFER INVESTMENT RISK THE RISK OF FAILING TO EARN ENOUGH TO PAY THE PROMISED RATES
THAT'S WHERE FIRST EXECUTIVE WHICH HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON REINSURANCE TO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF IT BUSINESS AND THE REGULATORS HAVEN'T AGREED ON THE PROPER FORM OF CONTRACT

SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
BY CONTRACTING OUT PRODUCTION TO AMERICAN PLANTS THEY ARE SAVING MORE THAN A DIME PER CAN OF DRINK
THEIR NEXT LOGICAL STEP ANALYSTS SAY WILL BE TO ACQUIRE U. S. SOFT DRINK CONCERNS
EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT EVEN BREAK INTO THE ENORMOUS U. S. MARKET
AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
THE PLOT IS A TRUE LIFE TALE OF M. C. A. ITSELF AND THE ENDING HAS YET TO BE PLAYED OUT

THE SINGAPORE ECONOMY AFTER ITS FIRST DOWNTURN IN NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IS ON THE RE- ROAD TO RECOVERY ANALYSTS SAY
AFTER CONTRACTING ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE ISLAND'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GREW ONE POINT NINE PERCENT LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INITIAL ESTIMATES
EXPANSION OF THREE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT IS PREDICTED FOR THIS YEAR
THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER
TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT OVER SALARIES THEY PUT HER FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR ANNUAL INCOME IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND LIVE OFF HIS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME

IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF ITS PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS
UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE

HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
ARE THE DANES SUPPOSED TO LISTEN SERIOUSLY TO SECRETARY SHULTZ WHEN HE TELLS THEM THAT THE PROPOSED DANISH POLICY TOWARD SHIPS UNDERCUTS THE NUCLEAR DETERRENCE OF NATO

HAVEN'T AMERICAN DIPLOMATS AT NATO BEEN TELLING EVERYONE THAT COMPARED WITH THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF NOT RATI(FYING)- RATIFYING THE TREATY THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF RATIFICATION WOULD BE MINIMAL
MANY FUND MANAGERS HERE SAY AMERICA ISN'T TAKING THE STRONG MEDICINE NEEDED TO CURB HIGH CONSUMER SPENDING IMPROVE LOW PERSONAL SAVINGS RATES AND COMBAT THE STU(BBORN)- STUBBORN DUAL DEFICITS
THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY PROGRESS BEFORE THE NEW U. S. PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR AND SAY BOTH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES PROBABLY WILL RISE
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A: NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION
MR. KAVNER SAID THE RIVAL GROUP LACKS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DIFFERENCES

THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
WITH THE SPEAKER BEHIND IT GEPHARDT WILL PASS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR SAID REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PEASE DEMOCRAT OF OHIO
ADDED REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DONNELLY DEMOCRAT OF MASSACHUSETTS ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE
HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY UNLESS HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A PROVISION LIKE GEPHARDT
ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
IF THE PR- PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
THE UNION SAID THE ENGINEERS WERE LEAVING THEIR VESSELS WHEN THEY DOCKED
LATE YESTERDAY NINETEEN SHIPS WERE REPORTED TO BE TIED UP BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE
THE UNION WHICH REPRESENTS ENGINEERS ON ABOUT EIGHTY GREAT LAKES SHIPS HAS BEEN WITHOUT A CONTRACT SINCE MAY THIRTY ONE
THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE A- ANALYSTS
IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
AS OF APRIL ONE ALL INTEREST INCOME WILL BE TAXED AT TWENTY PERCENT
EXEMPTIONS INCLUDE SINGLE MOTHERS THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD
OTHER EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING AND PENSIONS
THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
MR. HOWARD NOT ONLY HELPED THE FLEDGLING PUBLIC COMPANIES DRUM UP INTEREST IN THEIR SHARES HE HELPED INVEST THE CAPITAL THEY RAISED IN THE PUBLIC OFFERINGS
IN MANY CASES THE BANKS HE ADVISED INVESTED LARGE AMOUNTS IN EACH OTHER

WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER TWO
IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE B- TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS
SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE SWANSON COMPANY BEGAN SELLING FROZEN POT PIES TURKEY CHICKEN AND MEAT

STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
<NOISE> FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR

STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
<NOISE> SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED
<NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
<NOISE> THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY ONE PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED

DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICE OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
HIS SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORP.
THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND ONE QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
<NOISE> THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAYS BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
AND HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENTED SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
THE RECURRING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HANDS ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO <NOISE>
IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
<NOISE> RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED ON IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY

IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS SOGGY AND MOLDY
WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO ME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T

THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
<NOISE> ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON A COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
<NOISE> AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES

<NOISE> LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
*BESIDES* SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
<NOISE> MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM

<NOISE> BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION OF DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE

THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK

JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
OCTOBER THIRTY ONE WASTE MANAGEMENT'S BOARD MEETS
CHEMLAWN IS DISCUSSED ONLY BRIEFLY AND IS RULED OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET BY MR. BUNTROCK

I DON'T KNOW IF JESSE JACKSON EVER DREAMED OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE GROWING UP POOR AND BLACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA

SOUTHWESTERN BELL HAS THIRTY DAYS TO CONTEST THE COMPLAINT
THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A FINAL DECISION BY THE END OF THE YEAR

DRUGS ALCOHOL CRIME
THERE'S NO GOOD NEWS ANYMORE
I'M HOPING WE GET A PRESIDENT WHO CLEANS OUT AMERICA
DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COSTS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
A JUDGE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELVE
AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID R- RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS PER TON PROFIT
TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS

ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
ON THE SURFACE THE TRADE REPORT LOOKED ENCOURAGING
THE NATION'S SEASONALLY ADJUSTED TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED TO EIGHT POINT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN JUNE THE LOWEST MONTHLY DEFICIT SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT OH TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TEN POINT TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ORIGINALLY REPORTED
SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRY EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR

CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SUGGEST IRAN IS THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZING TERRORIST STRIKES AGAINST AMERICAN WEST EUROPEAN AND ARAB TARGETS
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS *ALERTED* EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES OF AN INCREASED THREAT
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY INTELLIGENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT IRAN HAS LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR TERRORISM IN THE U. S.
WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF A COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY *SUBSIDIARIES*
BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
HOWEVER THE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING
THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND THE FURTHER AMOUNT REQUIRED IS EXPECTED TO FLOW FROM THE PROCEEDS OF OVERSEAS REINSURANCE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE
TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
THIRTY ONE TEAMS OF NINETEEN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND ASSORTED OTHER GROUPS SIGNED UP FOR THE FIRST LOCAL COMPETITION
FOR WEEKS DRUMS WERE HEARD ALONG THE WILLAMETTE AS TEAMS PRACTICED
BOATS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN IN BUSINESS SUITS FRESH FROM WORK OR HAPPY HOUR WERE NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT
THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR VERSUS
M. I. T. E. SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
OGILVY IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BILLINGS OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS
ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE BILLINGS CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE U. S. MR. ROMAN SAID
AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEP:OSITORY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT STILL IS CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOW GROWTH
FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM

HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY

THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND A NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS WITH SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAG:ED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN A. S. E. A. N. POWERS
SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION

THE SWISS FRANC BOND MARKET MEANWHILE REMAINED LISTLESS DESPITE A SHARP FALL IN THE DOLLAR
MOST PRICES WERE UNCHANGED WITH AVERAGE TURNOVER TRADERS SAID
ONE GENEVA TRADER SAID INVESTORS WERE STAYING OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS IN THE DOLLAR'S CURRENT DECLINE
CLOSELY HELD TRANSAMERICAN SAID IT ALSO AGREED TO SETTLE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER CREDITOR MEDALLION OIL COMPANY
THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WOULD REMOVE TWO MAJOR HURDLES IN TRANSAMERICAN'S LONG STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF THE CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS
TRANSAMERICA FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT
I RECEIVED WELFARE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN
LUCKILY I WAS ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY TO GET A GOOD JOB AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

<NOISE> HOW SERIOUS AND PATIENT INVESTOR INTEREST IS WILL BE TESTED NEXT MONTH
A GOVERNMENT OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY IS SET TO AUCTION OFF THE HYATT REGENCY MANILA
THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION
THUS INSTEAD OF CALMART'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE RELATIVELY SAFE FROM HANDS
CALMAT WOULD RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE IS SUCH THING AS EVIL
BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER AT ALL THIS WEEK
THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
<NOISE> LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL OF THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO *ADEQUATELY* INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
THE NEW TAX LAW LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY *INVIOLATE* CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
<NOISE> <NOISE> J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION
ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
DESPITE ALL OF THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
UNTIL NOW *NASDAQ* OR OTHER N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEMS HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
STILL THE COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. ASKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
<NOISE> JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
THE E. P. A. PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR MUNICIPAL TRASH DUMPS THAT THE AGENCY ESTIMATED WILL COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

ALSO BOLSTERING THE DOLLAR TRADERS SAID WAS FEAR OF CENTRAL BANK INTERVENTION BUYING DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE U. S. CURRENCY
ANOTHER WAS PERSIAN GULF TENSIONS
THE DOLLAR OFTEN IS REGARDED AS A SAFE INVESTMENT IN TIMES OF TURMOIL
ALTHOUGH MY TENTH MOVE HAD SET A STANDARD TRAP THREATENING TO WIN HIS KING PAWN MR. KASPAROV HAD TAKEN COUNTERMEASURES
IT IS SOON APPARENT THAT I AM PRESENTING HIM WITH NO MORE DIFFICULTIES MEANWHILE HE CONTROLS MORE SQUARES
WHILE HE IS TAKING LONG THINKS OFTEN MORE THAN ONE MINUTE AGAINST MR. BONIN HE USUALLY MOVES INSTANTLY AGAINST ME
MY ERRONEOUS QUEEN MANEUVER SENDS THE CHAMPION INTO HIS FIRST LONG STARE AT MY BOARD
HE'S REALLY TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY HE'S TRYING VERY HARD COMMENTS A SPECTATOR INTERNATIONAL MASTER NORMAN WEINSTEIN
BUT I FIND IT HARD TO CONCENTRATE I AM GETTING INTERESTED IN THE BONIN GAME
OPTIONS AND PROGRAM TRADES ARE NOT UNIQUE TO STOCK MARKETS
IN COMMERCIAL PROPERTY CIRCLES ONE FREQUENTLY BUYS OR SELLS AN OPTION ON A BUILDING
AND SOME FIRMS ARE SO LARGE THAT THEY BUY MANY PROPERTIES AT ONCE ESSENTIALLY TREATING PROPERTY AS A COMMODITY OR A COMPOSITE ASSET
UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS A- ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
THUS TRADERS SAY THE TREASURY PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SELL ITS USUAL VOLUME OF NEW LONG TERM BONDS IN ITS AUGUST FINANCING OPERATION
THERE'S NO PROSPECT OF NEW BONDS COMING ANYTIME SOON SAID DAVID H. RESLER A VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED
SO THERE'S A SCARCITY ISSUE
THE EQUITY PEOPLE AND THE FUTURES PEOPLE HAVE JOINT AND MUTUAL INTERESTS SAID RICHARD L. SANDOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED IN CHICAGO
I APPLAUD THE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO GET SOME JOINT ACTION
IT'S A MILESTONE IN THAT REGARD
HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE

AT THE APRIL OPENING OF A FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GUANGDONG POWER PLANT OFFICIALDOM HEAPED PRAISE ON MR. WU FOR BEATING A CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE
INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
WE LOVE THESE HORSES HE SAYS
WE HAVE A RECESSION BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE RICH
IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE AND PICTURES YOU WANT A HORSE ARABIAN HORSE
EXACTLY LIKE AMERICA

<NOISE> CAPITAL CITIES A. B. C. DECLINED TO A- COMMENT ON THE TALKS
WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID
BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL
HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG
IN A LEVERAGED BUYOUT A GROUP OF INVESTORS BUYS A COMPANY AND TAKES IT PRIVATE USING MOSTLY BORROWED FUNDS TO FINANCE THE TRANSACTION
CASH FLOW AND OFTEN ASSET SALES ARE USED TO PAY DOWN THE DEBT
FOR INVESTORS THE APPEAL IS THE PROSPECT OF A BIG RETURN WHEN THE RE:STRUCTURED COMPANY IS REFINANCED OR SOLD IN A FEW YEARS
BURLINGTON ALSO HAS BEEN MOVING AGGRESSIVELY IN COURT TO COUNTER THE HOSTILE BID
YESTERDAY IT FILED ITS SECOND LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GROUP AND DISCLOSED THAT IT MAY TURN THE TABLES AND SEEK TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF MONTREAL BASED DOMINION
THE PAC MAN DEFENSE IS NAMED AFTER THE VIDEO GAME IN WHICH A PLAYER TRIES TO GOBBLE UP HIS FOE BEFORE THE PLAYER IS SWALLOWED
ANSWER THE PRESS ASSERTS THIS ALL THE TIME AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
I MUST SAY I HAVE NOT YET FOUND THAT THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE PROBLEM
I MEAN THE EUROPEAN BANKS HAVE BEEN BETTER RESERVED THAN WE FOR A LONG TIME
IT HASN'T SEEMED TO AFFECT THE DIALOGUE ALL THAT MUCH
<NOISE> NUCLEAR POWER "QUOTE REMAINS TODAY FRAUGHT WITH POTENTIAL FOR GREAT DANGER TO HUMAN LIFE "UNQUOTE MR. MIKVA WROTE
"QUOTE CONGRESS THUS LIMITED THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMISSION IN CARRYING OUT THE MANDATE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
<NOISE> CONGRESS LEFT NO ROOM FOR THE COMMISSION WHEN OPERATING WITHIN THIS SPHERE TO USE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS "UNQUOTE
<NOISE> ALSO PROVIDING SOME SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS
THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS
THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS
INSTEAD DAYTON HUDSON'S EARNINGS HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR BY MERCHANDISING PROBLEMS IN ITS MERVYN'S DEPARTMENT STORE UNIT
<NOISE> ANALYSTS SAID THE TROUBLE STARTED WITH MERVYN'S CONCENTRATING TOO MUCH ON OPENING NEW STORES AND NOT ENOUGH ON PROVIDING BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE
TOP MANAGEMENT WAS SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEMS SOME ANALYSTS SAID
AND MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN TOO OPTIMISTIC IN PREDICTING THE TIMING OF A TURNAROUND THE ANALYSTS SAID
WALL STREET IN GENERAL HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT G. M. IN RECENT WEEKS BECAUSE OF ITS NEW LABOR CONTRACT
THE THREE YEAR PACT INCLUDES A JOB SECURITY PROGRAM THAT PREVENTS LAYOFFS EXCEPT DURING A SALES DROP PREVENTS PLANT CLOSINGS AND SLOWS ATTRITION
MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE PROVISIONS WILL HAMPER G. M.'S EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE OPERATIONS AND SHED UNCOMPETITIVE PLANTS PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OPERATIONS
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
<NOISE> B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND ONE QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED

<NOISE> FOR HIS AMNESTY APPLICATION MR. CALDERA NEEDS THE BOSS'S SIGNATURE TO HELP PROVE THAT HE HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR AT LEAST NINETY DAYS
ACTUALLY MR. CALDERA HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS
<NOISE> THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
<NOISE> NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
<NOISE> THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS
NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
BORG WARNER EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO FORTY ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS ON SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SHARES
MINSTAR AND BEAR STEARNS ENTERED INTO AN OPTION AGREEMENT FOR THE POSSIBLE PURCHASE OF THREE MILLION TWENTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BORG WARNER SHARES
THE PURCHASES WOULD BOOST MINSTAR'S BORG WARNER STAKE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT
YESTERDAY G. A. F. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED A NINE POINT NINE SIX PERCENT INVESTMENT STAKE IN BORG WARNER
<NOISE> LAST MONTH PIEDMONT'S BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY ACCEPT NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY FOR SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
NORFOLK SOUTHERN HAS A STAKE IN PIEDMONT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
BUT ONE DAY AFTER THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION U. S. AIR SWEETENED ITS INITIAL BID FOR PIEDMONT FORCING THE BOARD TO DROP ITS RECOMMENDATION
<NOISE> IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
<NOISE> THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED <NOISE> THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
<NOISE> DURING TESTIMONY IN APRIL FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DANIEL OLIVER SAID THE LEGISLATION WOULD RESTRAIN COMPETITION
HE ARGUED THAT SELLING DRUGS POSES NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR PHYSICIANS
<NOISE> THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS URGED STATE LEGISLATURES TO OPPOSE SIMILAR MEASURES
WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
AND SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW AND WAITING
BOND TRADERS ALSO WERE CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS
THE DROP HAS INDICATED TO SOME ANALYSTS THAT INFLATION FEARS WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
<NOISE> PREVIOUSLY OIL PRICES HAD SURGED ABOVE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL LARGELY ON FEAR THAT GROWING TENSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF MIGHT LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES
IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFECTIONS FROM HILL SAMUEL'S ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEMBER CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP ACCORDING TO INSIDERS AND OFFICIALS OF OTHER BANKS
AS PART OF T. S. B. THE DEPARTMENT MAINLY WOULD SERVE SMALL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
MANY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM HAD SOUGHT AN ALLIANCE WITH A LARGER GLOBAL PARTNER
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAD THOUGHT THE OPERATION WOULD BE SOLD TO BARCLAYS BANK P. L. C.
<NOISE> PROTESTERS IN BANGLADESH FOUGHT POLICE AND POLITICAL OPPONENTS AFTER VOTING RESUMED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS

VOTING HAD RESUMED ON SATURDAY
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW PORING OVER MR. SEOW'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS ASKING HOW HE'S BEEN PAYING HIS PHONE BILLS THESE PAST TEN YEARS
SIMILAR INQUIRIES LED TO THE EXPULSION FROM PARLIAMENT LAST DECEMBER OF JOSHUA B. JEYARETNAM LEAVING ONLY ONE OPPOSITION M. P.
A TEAM CANDIDATE PROPOSAL NOW UNDER STUDY WOULD ALSO SEEM L- LIKELY TO KEEP THE OPPOSITION FROM FINDING ITS WAY INTO GOVERNMENT OFFICE
BUT SINGAPORE'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION CITIZENS AREN'T LIKELY TO BENEFIT QUITE SO MUCH AS THE POLITICIANS OF MR. LEE'S RULING PARTY
COTTON FUTURES PRICES FOR COTTON FROM THE CURRENT CROP ROSE ON BUYING MOSTLY BY TRADERS WHO FOLLOW CHART SIGNALS
THE ADVANCE IN TURN PULLED UP PRICES F- OF DELIVERY MONTHS REPRESENTING THE NEW CROP SEASON WHICH WILL BEGIN AUGUST THE FIRST
THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIVE NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FOUR EIGHT CENTS
<NOISE> THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP POINT FIVE EIGHTHS OF A CENT TO SIXTY POINT THREE SIX CENTS A POUND
ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED
BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE
HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE

INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE
THE MINE IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE BETWEEN THIRTEEN MILLION AND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF STEAMING COAL ANNUALLY USED AT ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS SAYS MR. OGDEN
ALL BUT TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT MOSTLY TO JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND HONG KONG
SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
<NOISE> BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
THE BRODERICK MEN ARE ATTRACTED TO LEAH BECAUSE SHE IS AN HONEST WOMAN IN A WORLD OF PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE
<NOISE> SHE CAN MANIPULATE IDEOLOGY AND IMAGE TO FURTHER RADICAL CAUSES BUT SHE DOESN'T CONFUSE HER POLITICAL STRATAGEMS WITH REALITY
INDEED SHE HAS NO PERSONAL DEVOTION TO THOSE CAUSES THEY ARE SIMPLY VEHICLES FOR HER PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
THIS FASCINATES AND BAFFLES THE MEN AROUND HER
<NOISE> ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
<NOISE> CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
ALTHOUGH OPEC HAS TOYED WITH VOLUNTARY QUOTAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IT DIDN'T REALLY BECOME SERIOUS ABOUT PRODUCTION CURBS UNTIL AFTER LAST YEAR'S COLLAPSE IN OIL PRICES
MEMBER COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO ARGUE HOWEVER OVER THE FAIRNESS OF THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN QUOTAS AND EACH HAS REASON TO REPORT LESS THAN IT IS PRODUCING
THE PROBLEM SAYS A SENIOR OPEC OFFICIAL IS THAT RIGID QUOTAS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A FLEXIBLE OIL MARKET
<NOISE> WITH ONE EAR LAURA SLOATE LISTENS TO A MAN READING HEADLINES FROM SIX NEWSPAPERS
WITH THE OTHER EAR SHE MONITORS AN AIDE READING HER MAIL
MEANWHILE SHE IS KEEPING UP A CONVERSATION SORT OF
CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID
IT WAS THROUGH THESE CORRESPONDENT BANKS THAT MANUFACTURERS GOT ALL OF THESE ENERGY LOANS THAT HAVE SOURED
<NOISE> HOWEVER ONE MANUFACTURERS EXECUTIVE SAID HE DOUBTED CORRESPONDENT BANKING WOULD BE ELIMINATED IN LIGHT OF THAT BUSINESS'S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RECENTLY
THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
MR. SMITH SAID TRADING IN BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES WOULD RESUME EARLY TODAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
TRADING WAS SUSPENDED AT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PENCE OR SEVEN DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS WEDNESDAY
<NOISE> <NOISE> ANALYSTS PREDICTED EARLY YESTERDAY THAT THE SHARES WOULD FALL WHEN TRADING RESUMED WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE E. C. AND BRITISH GOVERNMENT
PROCESSORS BLAME THEIR SUPPLIERS
CARGILL INCORPORATED A MAJOR CORN SYRUP MAKER SAYS IT IS PAYING COOPERATIVES FARMERS AND ELEVATORS MORE FOR THEIR CORN
A SPOKESMAN SAYS SELLERS KNOW THEY CAN GO TO OTHER BUYERS

AS FOR THE PRICES CARGILL CHARGES HE ADDS WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE MAXIMUM PRICE FOR OUR PRODUCTS ALL THE TIME
VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
THE COVERAGE BETWEEN ADS SOME COMPLAIN IS FRAGMENTED AND SHIFTY JUMPING TOO QUICKLY AMONG MYRIAD SPORTS
<NOISE> ACTUAL EVENTS AS OPPOSED TO TAPED PROFILES PREVIEWS AND REPORTS TAKE UP LESS THAN HALF OF THE AIRTIME
MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
IN PHILIPS SUN HAS WON A EUROPEAN ALLY THAT IT HOPES WILL PROVIDE AN EDGE OVER COMPETITORS
<NOISE> MOTOROLA I- INCORPORATED MIPS COMPUTER SYSTEMS INCORPORATED AND HEWLETT PACKARD COMPANY ARE JOCKEYING TO WOO COMPUTER MAKERS TO THEIR OWN RISC CHIPS
THE CHIPS ARE RAPIDLY GAINING POPULARITY AMONG COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST CONVERTS COULD BECOME A DE FACTO STANDARD IN TOMORROW'S COMPUTER INDUSTRY
<NOISE> THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON A SEVEN TO SEVEN VOTE LAST MONTH EFFECTIVELY KILLED MR. LUCAS'S NOMINATION TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION
A MAJORITY WAS NEEDED TO SEND THE NOMINATION TO THE FULL SENATE
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT BUSH AND MR. THORNBURGH FOR NOMINATING MR. LUCAS WHO HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS A LAWYER AND NONE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATOR
THE LACK OF MARKET DEPTH YESTERDAY ENABLED SEVERAL LARGE BUY ORDERS TO SPARK THE DOLLAR RALLY
ONE NEW YORK TRADER SAID HE WITNESSED THE CURRENCY'S VALUE JUMP AS HIS BANK EXECUTED A PURCHASE ORDER FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SEVERAL CHUNKS
WHEN THERE ARE VERY FEW PLAYERS THAT KIND OF ORDER WILL MOVE THE MARKET SAID THE TRADER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
HE ALSO IS FOCUSING ON EL HERALD
WITH ONLY TWO NEWS REPORTERS AND A DESK OF TRANSLATORS IT LACKS VITALITY READERS SAY
MR. CASTILLO WANTS TO EXPAND THE SECTION AND SELL IT AS AN INDEPENDENT PAPER
HE WILL BEGIN TESTING STAND ALONE SALES THIS MONTH
HE HAD A POINT

OTHER ENTRANTS OFFER SUCH PEN NAMES AS GRANNY MR. DISCUSSION ANNA DARLING DEAR JOHN AND BEA READY
I SUGGEST A HIP MACHO NAME WITH QUICK READER IDENTIFICATION STAN LANDERS
I CAN PICTURE MY READERS IN A BAR AFTER WORK HEY DID YOU READ STAN THE MAN LANDERS THIS MORNING
THAT GUY GIVES GREAT ADVICE
RICHARD STEIN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FINANCE AT WORLDS OF WONDER SAID THE STOCK PROBABLY WAS MOVING DOWN IN SYMPATHY WITH OTHER TOY COMPANIES
HOWEVER HE SAID WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW TOY COMPANIES THAT EXPECT AN UP FOURTH QUARTER
HE SAID THE COMPANY IS EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS IN SALES OF TEDDY RUXPIN ITS TALKING TEDDY BEAR AND OF LASER TAG AN INFRARED GUN GAME
SOUNDS GOOD BUT WHAT'S THE CATCH
MR. LEMING A CHEMICALS ANALYST ISSUED HIS REPORT JUNE TWENTY SECOND WITH SEAGRAM TRADING AT SEVENTY SEVEN
IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTY SIX AND THREE EIGHTHS UP ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
THIS REASONING HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO GALVANIZE THE MARKET
MR. LEMING DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT YESTERDAY
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
PIZZA HUT FOR EXAMPLE IS DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY PIE AND HAS INTRODUCED SEVERAL GOURMET PIZZA
GODFATHER'S HAS INTRODUCED A LESS EXPENSIVE THIN CRUSTED PIE USED IN ITS TWO FOR ONE SPECIALS
IT DEVELOPED THE ECONOMY LINE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO CANNIBALIZE OUR PREMIUM PRODUCT SALES MR. HENDERSON SAYS
MR. FORBES SAID HE'D HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
I ASSURE YOU THAT FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
MR. FORBES SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME
HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS
IN EFFECT THEY ALREADY ARE OPERATING AS IF IN A RECESSION SO LAYOFFS MIGHT PROVE RELATIVELY MODEST
<NOISE> IN ADDITION THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURING IN THE ECONOMY HAS FADED IN COMPARISON WITH THE GROWTH OF RECESSION RESISTANT SERVICE JOBS
IN MOST MODERN NATIONS IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY WHEN CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE
<NOISE> NOR IS IT SUBVERSIVE TO EMBARRASS THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
SAD TO SAY IN SINGAPORE THIS SEEMS REASON ENOUGH TO INVOKE THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT
<NOISE> WITH EVERY NEW BOUT OF GOVERNMENT PANIC IT BECOMES CLEARER THAT THE REAL FOREIGN ELEMENTS MR. LEE FEARS ARE HIS CRITICS IN SINGAPORE
MANY LAWMAKERS BELIEVE IT IS THEIR DUTY TO BRING HOME THE BACON AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHY ANYONE WOULD THINK OTHERWISE
PORK BARRELING HAS GOTTEN A BAD NAME SAYS REPRESENTATIVE DOUGLAS BOSCO A CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR
IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE FEW TANGIBLE THINGS WE CAN DO IN CONGRESS
A POSSIBLE BACKLASH BY ENGLISH SPEAKING CANADIANS COULD BE THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN SELL THAT KEYBOARD TO CUSTOMERS IN VANCOUVER SAYS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A U. S. COMPUTER MAKER
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE STANDARD AMERICAN KEYBOARD
SHE EXPECTS THE KEYBOARD TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE ONLY WITH THE FEDERAL AND QUEBEC GOVERNMENTS
THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAY IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR
THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
FUJITSU'S BID FOR CONTROL OF FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR HAS LEFT THE PENTAGON DIVIDED
SOME FEAR A TAKEOVER OF THE MILITARY SUBCONTRACTOR COULD HURT NATIONAL SECURITY
BUT OTHERS SAY IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE JAPAN TO TRANSFER MILITARY TECHNOLOGY TO THE U. S.
THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SPOKESMAN JOSEPH COYNE SAID YESTERDAY'S ACTION WAS DONE ENTIRELY AT CITICORP'S INITIATIVE
ALTHOUGH FED OFFICIALS WERE ADVISED OF THE BANK'S PLANS IT WAS THEIR OWN JUDGMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESERVE POSITIONS THEY SHOULD MAKE MR. COYNE SAID
WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER BANKS
J. WALTER THOMPSON WILL RETAIN FORD'S U. S. CAR AND TRUCK ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH IT CREATED THE UBIQUITOUS HAVE YOU DRIVEN A FO:RD LATELY CAMPAIGN
IT ALSO WILL RETAIN SMALLER FORD ACCOUNTS IN SIX OTHER COUNTRIES AND IT CONTINUES TO BE FORD'S LARGEST AGENCY
BUT INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID THEY BELIEVED FORD WAS CONSIDERING GIVING ONE OF THOSE SIX ACCOUNTS FOR FORD'S LATIN AMERICAN AFFILIATE TO ANOTHER AGENCY
BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
KHRUSHCHEV SAW PARTY ACTIVISM AS A KEY TO BRINGING HIS AMBITIONS TO FRUITION PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL SECTOR

A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND AN APPEALS COURT BOTH IN RICHMOND UPHELD THE PLAN
BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THE APPEALS COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION IN LIGHT OF ANOTHER HIGH COURT RULING
LAST JULY THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST
<NOISE> PAST SOCIETAL BIAS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BASIS TO JUSTIFY THE PLAN THE APPEALS COURT SAID IN AN OPINION WRITTEN BY JUDGE J. HARVIE WILKINSON THE THIRD

<NOISE> THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
BUT NEITHER EUROPEANS NOR AMERICANS SEEM ESPECIALLY EAGER
SOME EVEN CONTEND THAT CONVENTIONAL DEFENSES ARE ADEQUATE OR ARE GROWING IRRELEVANT
NOT SO INSISTS MR. ABSHIRE WHO BELIEVES ENHANCING NATO'S CAPABILITIES IS OF ACCELERATING IMPORTANCE
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT QUARTERS THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS WERE MASKED BY SEVERAL SPECIAL CHARGES
BEFORE A SIX MILLION DOLLAR LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PHILLIPS HAD PROFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR FIVE CENTS A SHARE
THAT PROFIT INCLUDED A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM ASSET SALES AND AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR CHARGE FROM STAFF REDUCTIONS
MUCH OF THE LITIGATION INVOLVING BUSINESS BROKERS CENTERS ON THE LARGER BETTER STAFFED CONCERNS CONCERNS LIKE BUSINESS BUYERS
<NOISE> THAT COMPANY WHICH EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENTS BUYERS SAYS IT HAS SIGNED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLIENTS SINCE IT OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO

HOWEVER THESE LEGISLATORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

WE DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THE PROBLEM SAID JEFFREY LANE PRESIDENT OF SHEARSON
<NOISE> MR. LANE SAID HE WOULD RATHER SEE WALL STREET MODIFY ITS BEHAVIOR THAN HAVE WASHINGTON REGULATORS CLAMP DOWN
WE'RE GIVING UP SHORT TERM GAINS FOR THE GOOD OF OUR CLIENTS HE ASSERTED
I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
THE PRODUCT IS AN LEGITIMATE HEDGING PRODUCT AND A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD LIQUIDITY TO THE MARKET
UNLIKE TRADITIONAL WHOLE LIFE POLICIES IN WHICH THE PREMIUM AND DEATH BENEFIT ARE FIXED UNIVERSAL LIFE GIVES HOLDERS CONSIDERABLE LATITUDE TO VARY THEIR PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS
BUT IT HAS LIMITED GUARANTEES AND MUCH INVESTMENT RISK IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOLDER
PREMIUM DOLLARS ARE INVESTED IN THE SAVING PORTION OF THE PLAN AND MONEY IS DEDUCTED PERIODICALLY TO PAY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE INSURANCE COVERAGE
PRICES AT THE MASS RETAIL LEVEL HOWEVER HAVEN'T RISEN MUCH IN A DECADE PARTLY BECAUSE BIG RETAILERS USE TENNIS BALLS TO LURE SHOPPERS

TWO WEEKS AGO I PICKED UP A CAN FOR A DOLLAR EIGHTY NINE
<NOISE> DAVID MEISTER F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
<NOISE> WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS HALF A DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
FOOD BUYERS FOR ONE TEXAS SUPERMARKET CHAIN FURR'S INCORPORATED HAVE EVEN ASKED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT ACCORDING TO ONE MANUFACTURER
I JUST LAUGHED SAID THE SALES MANAGER OF A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CANDY COMPANY WHO REFUSED THE DEMAND
FURR'S WOULDN'T CONFIRM OR DENY THE CLAIM
HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM
SOME WERE QUITE VEHEMENT IN RESISTING ANY CHANGE
IF A COMPANY DID THIS I WOULDN'T FOLLOW THEM ANYMORE SAID ONE NEW YORK ANALYST
ISSUERS OF ABBREVIATED ANNUAL REPORTS ARE REALLY SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR THE TYPICAL SHAREHOLDER SAID ANOTHER

MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
MR. GIORDANO OF GOLDMAN SACHS PARTLY AGREES
<NOISE> IF INVESTORS SAW THE WORLD LIKE I SEE THE WORLD THEY'D BE IN A DEFENSIVE PORTFOLIO POSITION HE SAID

HE PREDICTED THAT IT WILL BE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE WE LEARN WHETHER THE F. D. I. C. HAS CHOSEN OUR PLAN OR ANOTHER ONE
BANKS THAT COMMIT TO THE NEW CREDIT BY TODAY GET A FEE EQUAL TO POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THEY COMMIT
IT WON'T BE CLEAR UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND HOW MANY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED

OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S *STOCK* MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS

A CANADIAN TRUST COMPANY IS SIMILAR TO A U. S. SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION
U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY

I'M SURE THIS WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT ON MY BUSINESS SAYS DEALER JOHN WEBER IN NEW YORK
I CAN ANTICIPATE THAT CORPORATE BUYING OF ART WILL BE AFFECTED DOWN THE PIKE

I'VE LIVED THROUGH RECESSIONS BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT TO REAL COLLECTORS ART IS AN OBSESSION
THE SUPER RICH ARE NOT GOING TO STOP INDULGING THEMSELVES
THE PRESIDENT STRESSED THAT HE IS PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO LAW THROUGH CONGRESS AND WITH COMPLETE PRESS FREEDOM

DAVID HOCKNEY HAS BEEN A KIND OF WUNDERKIND ON THE INTERNATIONAL ART SCENE SINCE HE BURST UPON IT IN HIS NATIVE BRITAIN IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES
HE IS NOW FIFTY YEARS OLD AND THIS MID CAREER RETROSPECTIVE AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM MAKES CLEAR ONCE AGAIN HOW PRECOCIOUS AND PROLIFIC HE HAS BEEN
IN FACT THE PROFUSION AND VARIETY OF MR. HOCKNEY'S WORK <NOISE> SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN THE SHOW'S ORGANIZERS SOME PROBLEMS WITH ITS PRESENTATION
FOR ALTHOUGH MR. HOCKNEY'S TALENT AND ORIGINALITY ARE GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED HE IS REGARDED IN SOME QUARTERS AS MORE OF A GIFTED ILLUSTRATOR THAN A MAJOR ARTIST
AND SINCE IN RECENT YEARS HIS WORK HAS TENDED TO BE INCREASINGLY DECORATIVE A CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT WAS APPARENTLY THOUGHT TO BE TOO RISKY
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION EXCORIATED DANIEL ORTEGA FOR HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CONTRAS
IT CONTINUES TO QUIBBLE WITH PRETORIA FOR IGNORING THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS
BUT IN A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION OF INCONSISTENCY IT NOT ONLY APPLAUDS ISRAEL'S DEAFNESS TO THE P. L. O. IT STUFFS LEGISLATIVE PLUGS IN ITS OWN EARS AS WELL
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
AND AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST
MR. KAVNER SAID THE RIVAL GROUP LACKS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DIFFERENCES

CHICAGO CENTRAL AND PACIFIC IS ONE OF A SLEW OF NEW RAILROADS THAT ARE BEING CREATED AS MAJOR RAILROADS SELL LIGHTLY USED TRACKS
MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THEM HAVE BEEN FORMED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY COMPARED WITH FORTY SEVEN DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION SAYS
MOST ARE SHORT LINES WITH FEWER THAN A HUNDRED MILES AND SOME ARE MUCH LONGER REGIONAL LINES OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILES
THE STATE SETS THE OFFICIAL RATE CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED ZLOTYS TO THE DOLLAR
IT SETS THE PRICE OF VODKA NOW ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED ZLOTYS
THE STATE DOESN'T RUN THE BLACK MARKET OF COURSE
BUT ITS POLICE DON'T BREAK THE BIG RINGS EITHER
THEY SEEM CONTENT TO LET THE POLES TRADE THEIR LETTUCE
SOONER OR LATER PEWEX WILL GET MOST OF IT ANYWAY
ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION A YEAR
BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION A WEEK
IT IS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
HALLMARK HOWEVER HAS SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE THESE STATIONS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE FORMAT

A PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFTED FEDERAL BLUEPRINT ENVISAGED STATES CLUSTERING INTO A DOZEN OR SO REGIONAL COMPACTS <NOISE> EACH WITH ITS OWN DISPOSAL SITE
BUT STATES HAVE RUN INTO ENORMOUS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC OBSTACLES IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THESE AGREEMENTS

IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
THE U. S. SUGGESTED THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AWARD THE PRIVATE TERMINAL CONTRACTS ONLY TO JAPANESE FIRMS THAT PROMISE TO USE FOREIGN SUBCONTRACTORS

JAPANESE COMPANIES PREFER TO DIVIDE THE WORK THAN COMPETE FOR IT
PLUNGING INTO A MARKET MOST INVESTORS ARE STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE HENLEY SPENDS SIX MILLION DOLLARS
FOR TEN DAYS IT BUYS TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE SANTA FE SHARES TRADED AND LIFTS ITS STAKE TO FOURTEEN PERCENT FROM FIVE PERCENT
SANTA FE DOESN'T MAKE A MOVE WHICH MR. DINGMAN TAKES AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
IF I WERE IN THEIR SHOES I'D BE BUYING MY DAMNED STOCK HE ARGUES
AS JAPAN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE GROWN AND BECOME MORE INTERNATIONAL SO HAS FOREIGN PRESSURE ON JAPAN TO CLEAN UP WHAT MANY PERCEIVE AS UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES
AS A START JAPAN REVISED ITS SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE LAW LAST MAY
NOW THE FINANCE MINISTRY IS WRITING THE DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES THAT WILL GIVE THE NEW LAW MUSCLE WHEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT NEXT APRIL

IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THREW OUT OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANCE BY INSTANCE CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS
THE OFFICIAL ALSO SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
<NOISE> INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE
BUYING STAMPS THROUGH A COMPUTER NETWORK SIGHT UNSEEN COULD BE HAZARDOUS
AFTER U. S. WARPLANES STRUCK LIBYA LAST APRIL RICHARD ROBINSON DROPPED PLANS FOR A TWO WEEK VACATION IN FRANCE AND IRELAND FEARING AN INCREASE IN TERRORISM
NOW MR. ROBINSON A DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED STOCKBROKER IN BOCA RATON FLORIDA PLANS TO VISIT WEST GERMANY THIS JUNE

AFTER MUCH CONFLICT SECRETARY OF STATE CYRUS VANCE STRUCK A DEAL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
EACH EMBASSY COMPLEX HAD TO BE OCCUPIED SIMULTANEOUSLY
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET UNION'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY WAS COMPLETED BY NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BEFORE WORK ON THE U. S.'S NEW MOSCOW EMBASSY HAD EVEN STARTED
THE SOVIETS THEN PUSHED TO OCCUPY THEIR NEW SITE BUT THE U. S. RESISTED UNTIL ITS OWN BUILDINGS WERE READY
AS THE U. S. BUILDINGS WERE COMPLETED IN MOSCOW THE SOVIETS WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THEIR NEW FACILITIES ON MOUNT ALTO
ONLY THE MAIN AMBASSADORIAL BUILDINGS AT EACH SITE ARE VACANT

MR. HOLMES A COURT ALSO FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SEEKING CLEARANCE TO BOOST HIS STAKE ABOVE TEN PERCENT <NOISE>
SUCH A FILING IS REQUIRED UNDER ANTITRUST LAW IF AN INVESTOR WISHES TO INCREASE HIS HOLDINGS ABOVE THAT LEVEL
IF HIS REQUEST IS GRANTED HE AND HIS GROUP COULD BUY AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF TEXACO
A PURCHASE OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER FILING WITH THE AGENCIES
HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY
G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S
IN A RECENT PAPER PRESENTED TO FELLOW LOBBYISTS MISS FARTHING EXPLAINED HOW TO GET LEVERAGE FROM SUCH A PROGRAM
SHE RECOMMENDED SENDING INVITATIONS FIRST TO MEMBERS OF TAX WRITING COMMITTEES AND TO SENIOR OPINION MOLDERS WHO LOBBY THEIR COLLEAGUES
SHE ALSO SUGGESTED SENDING A CAR TO FETCH THE LAWMAKER WHOSE GOODWILL YOU WISH TO STIMULATE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE CHECK IS ISSUED PROPERLY
SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR ROBERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY

DOCTOR ZAGURY SAID HIS VACCINE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A PROTOTYPE FOR TESTING BUT WHETHER IT CONFERS PROTECTION AGAINST AIDS HASN'T BEEN PROVED
THE ULTIMATE TEST OF EFFICACY EXPOSING THE VACCINATED SUBJECTS TO THE LIVE AIDS VIRUS HASN'T BEEN DONE FOR ETHICAL REASONS
HOWEVER THE NEXT STEP IS TO TEST A VACCINE IN A LARGE GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS
DOCTOR ZAGURY SAID HE IS TRYING TO STREAMLINE HIS BOOSTER PROCEDURE TO MAKE IT MORE WIDELY APPLICABLE
ODDLY AND SADLY NEITHER CANDIDATE HAS TALKED MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE
MAYBE IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO SLOGANS
MAYBE MESSRS.
BUSH AND DUKAKIS THINK THAT LIKE TAXES IT CRIPPLED WALTER MONDALE FOUR YEARS AGO
MAYBE IT'S AN ISSUE THE CANDIDATES HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
WE HAVE A SEVERE BUSINESS SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S APPRECIATION AND TRADE FRICTION AN OFFICIAL OF BROTHER INDUSTRIES SAYS
IN MID NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE COMPANY WILL BE MAKING ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS IN BARTLETT TENNESSEE
IT SET UP A SIMILAR PLANT IN WALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
BALLY'S DRIVE INTO THE HOTEL CASINO INDUSTRY HAS MADE HEALTH CLUBS AN INCREASINGLY AWKWARD FIT ANALYSTS SAID AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DIVESTITURE
BY SHEDDING THE HEALTH CLUB LINE BALLY COULD FOCUS ON ITS REMAINING OPERATIONS GAMBLING MACHINES STATE LOTTERIES AND AMUSEMENT CENTERS
ANALYSTS ALSO QUESTION THE FIT OF THE COMPANY'S THEME PARKS THOUGH SAYING A SALE OF THAT OPERATION COULD FOLLOW
THE NEW POLICY ISN'T CLEARLY DELINEATED
IT STIPULATES THAT NO NEW DEFENSE CONTRACT WILL BE SIGNED
BUT MR. PERES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO REPORTERS' QUESTIONS ON HOW LONG EXISTING ARMS EXPORT CONTRACTS WITH SOUTH AFRICA WILL RUN

THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR V.
MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
<NOISE> THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
THE SYSTEM ISN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
THE COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF OR IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY
BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAS TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULT(S)-
BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR
AS A RESULT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING
AND THAT COULD LEAD THE FED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES IN AN EFFORT TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY IN THE COMING MONTHS
<NOISE> TO BE SURE A FEW COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO USE THE OLYMPICS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM A SUBCONTRACTOR TO AN INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN BRAND
KUKJE CORPORATION SHIFTED FROM PRODUCING NIKE SHOES TO DEVELOPING ITS OWN PRO SPECS LINE OF ATHLETIC SHOES FIVE YEARS AGO
IT PAID FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND GOODS TO BE AN OFFICIAL SPONSOR OF THE GAMES AND HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE LOGO IN ITS ADVERTISING
KUKJE HOPES THE OLYMPICS WILL HELP GIVE PRO SPECS A FOOTHOLD IN EUROPE
THE NEW EMPHASIS ON MAKING SCHOOLS WORK HAS PUSHED ASIDE SOME OTHER LONGSTANDING SCHOOL DEBATES
DESEGREGATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS REMAINS A GOAL BUT IS ENTIRELY ELUSIVE IN MANY AREAS-
MANY FAMILIES THAT COULD WHITE OR BLACK FLED TO SUBURBAN PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS AS BUSING ALONE BECAME A MORE DISCUSSED ISSUE THAN SCHOOL CURRICULA
WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS YONKERS AND KANSAS CITY FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE LEARNED TO ESCHEW THEIR TRAGIC SOCIAL ENGINEERING
MOST NOW LEAVE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ALONE TO ATTRACT STUDENTS BACK NOT DRIVE THEM OUT
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RECESSION LIKE DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE STATISTICS SAID NORMAN ROBERTSON CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MELLON BANK CORPORATION
AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE FED WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A FAMILIAR WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE
SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
THIS REPORT DOESN'T INCLUDE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S OWN VERSION OF EVENTS

THE ONLY NOTICEABLE DECLINES WERE IN RESTAURANTS POINT SIX PERCENT AND FOOD STORES POINT THREE PERCENT

IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT

I THINK WE SHOULD GO INTO A PEACE PROCESS WITH THEM
I DON'T SEE OURSELVES GOING INTO A WAR AND THE AMERICANS DON'T SEE THEMSELVES GOING INTO A VIETNAM TYPE WAR IN CENTRAL AMERICA
SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS THAT DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING

<NOISE> AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES

<NOISE> THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHREYER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
<NOISE> SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING REGULATORS WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKET(S)-
<NOISE> MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE

<NOISE> IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
<NOISE> THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIE(S)-
THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION <NOISE> MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
TORONTO BASED P. L. C. MAKES PACKAGING AND FURNITURE

MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS <NOISE> WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET S- SHARE
THE MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
<NOISE> CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO RUN OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
<NOISE> PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL JAPAN'S N. K. A. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS

<NOISE> BUT THE PACE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAS BEEN NEGATIVE BY MY PREFERRED KA- MEASURE AND GLACIAL BY ANY OTHER
<NOISE> <NOISE> STILL THE NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTS A REMARKABLE CONCEPTUAL LEAP IN THE COMPUTER WORLD
<NOISE> IT IS A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCK IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUCH AS THE NEURONS IN HUMANS ARE THE VEHICLE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION
<NOISE> THE NETWORK HAS ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO CREATE THE FIRST CONVINCING LIKENESS OF THE BRAIN IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY AND VISION
DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE

THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION (PAREN LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE )END-THE-PAREN
<NOISE> THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS

OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
IF THE EXTRADITION EFFORT FAILS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT LOSES MORE THAN THE CHANCE TO PROSECUTE A KEY SUSPECT

INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
<NOISE> HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
<NOISE> IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS

<NOISE> MR. PERONI AGREED THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY IS A POSITIVE FACTOR FOR STOCK PRICES
THE BETTER BEHAVIOR OF THE DOLLAR IS A BIG INCENTIVE FOR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS TO STICK BOTH FEET IN THE WATER HE SAID
HE PREDICTED THAT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS COULD BE AS HIGH AS UPPER TWENTY TWO HUNDREDS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER
<NOISE> HOWEVER JOHN MENDELSON CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS BELIEVES SUCH A SLUMP COULD HAPPEN
I THINK YOU WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL TURNOVER LEVELS IN A BEAR MARKET
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO SEE A REAL DULL LOUSY MARKET

NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
<NOISE> BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SPECIALTY *RETAILING* TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON SEARS'S BOTTOM LINE
SEARS'S MERCHANDISE GROUP ALONE GENERATED PROFIT OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT

THE COMPANY DIDN'T ANNOUNCE THE VOTES OF THE APRIL THIRTY PROXY VOTE
NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY RESTRUCTURING CANDIDATE
ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS

LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE IN A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE <NOISE> AND IN A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY <NOISE> AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
<NOISE> THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE
ANNUAL GROWTH OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT AND GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
MR. BUCHI BELIEVES SUCH GROWTH CAN BE SUSTAINED
SOUTH AFRICA ANGOLA AND CUBA ENDED A ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT OR A DATE TO MEET AGAIN
BUT SOURCES SAID THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH INVOLVE NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PEACE IN ANGOLA HAVE MADE PROGRESS

U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

THOUGH THERE ISN'T A CURE FOR AIDS PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE CAN BE OFFERED TREATMENTS TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES
FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN TAKE MEDICATION TO PREVENT CATCHING THE KIND OF PNEUMONIA THAT MOST COMMONLY LEADS TO THE DEATH OF AIDS SUFFERERS
AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED AIDS CAN TAKE STEPS TO GUARD AGAINST OTHER DISEASES SUCH AS HERPES AND HEPATITIS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO ACCELERATE ITS ONSET
BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISKS PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING
NO LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS CAN MAKE A NUCLEAR FACILITY SAFE UNLESS IT HAS GOOD MANAGEMENT THE N. R. C. TOLD CONGRESS LAST YEAR
INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS
IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF ITS PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS

D. D. C. CAUSES A PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY TINGLING NUMBING AND PAIN PRINCIPALLY IN THE FEET THAT CAN REQUIRE POTENT PAINKILLERS SUCH AS MORPHINE
IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER SUCH SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE REVERSED DOCTOR SOO SAID
WHILE AIDS ALSO CAUSES SOME NEUROPATHY INCLUDING BOTH DISCOMFORT AND WEAKNESS IN THE HANDS AND FEET THE DRUG'S WORST SIDE EFFECT IS THE FOOT PAIN
DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
I COME WITH NO BAGGAGE WITH NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT THE BEST REGULATORY METHOD OR THE BEST WAY THE MARKET SHOULD OPERATE
I COME WITH VERY STRONG *CONCEPTUAL* SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS

SALES NEARLY DOUBLED TO ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM NINETY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
ALL SEVEN REGIONAL BELLS HAVE VOWED TO APPEAL THE DECEMBER THIRD RULING BY JUDGE HAROLD GREENE THAT FORBIDS THEM TO DESIGN FABRICATE OR ASSEMBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT
OF COURSE IF THE APPEAL FAILS MANY VENTURES COULD BE JEOPARDIZED OR SCRATCHED
BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
WHILE CAMPBELL IS CONFIDENT ITS MICROWAVE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LURE NEW CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAMPLED A FROZEN BREAKFAST OTHER COMPETITORS ARE WAFFLING
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM MICROWAVE WAFFLES SAID A SPOKESMAN AT I. C. INDUSTRIES
BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT THE TOASTER WAFFLES THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IN THIRTY SECONDS ARE MORE CONVENIENT AND BETTER QUALITY
A LORIMAR SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT MR. ADELSON AGREED TO BUY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND SHARES OF LORIMAR STOCK FROM MR. GARIN

ADELSON AND GARIN WAS ARRANGED BEFORE DISCUSSIONS RESUMED WITH WARNER
THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
<NOISE> THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS
STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WANT TO USE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GIVE LABOR THINGS IT NOW HAS DIFFICULTY WINNING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE
CONGRESS GETS CREDIT FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYERS FOOT THE BILL

BUT MIAMI VOTERS THREE TIMES REJECTED BOND ISSUES FOR REPAIRS AND OFFICIALS STRUNG MR. ROBBIE ALONG FOR YEARS WITHOUT MAKING IMPROVEMENTS CITING THE EXPENSE
WHEN HE THREATENED TO BUILD HIS OWN STADIUM HE RECALLS THE OFFICIALS ROLLED THEIR EYES AND SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE
NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES

<NOISE> FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
NON INTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING

MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
MOTIVES ARE MIXED
SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT

A GROUP OF M. FIFTEEN ZEALOTS UNDERTOOK APPARENTLY ON THEIR OWN TO DRIVE HIM FROM OFFICE
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED

A LIMITED STRIKE TARGETED AT KEY PLANTS A STRATEGY THE U. A. W. USED FOR A WEEK AGAINST G. M. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BUFFER THE IMPACT
A STRIKE AGAINST A SECOND COMPANY IN CANADA WHERE THE CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS UNION IS BARGAINING INDEPENDENTLY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME COULD BROADEN THE DAMAGE
THE C. A. W. HAS INDICATED IT WILL TARGET A DIFFERENT AUTO MAKER THAN THE U. A. W. AND IT HAS A WIDER SELECTION

ALBERT GROSS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT REFCO INC. AGREED
THE BOND MARKET WAS HELPED TEMPORARILY BY A DECLINE IN GOLD AND OTHER COMMODITY PRICES A STRENGTHENING DOLLAR AND A STOCK MARKET RALLY HE SAID
BUT I EXPECT THE DOLLAR TO CONTINUE FALLING AND THAT WILL ACCELERATE INFLATION PRESSURES
THE BEST NUMBERS ON INFLATION ARE BEHIND US
MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS
BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY
THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK

THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
MR. REAGAN'S COMMENTS DON'T REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION AGREEMENT
AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE THE PLAN SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD EITHER SIGN OR VETO THE SPECIFIC TAXES CONGRESS CHOOSES
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID BEFORE THAT IT ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROVISION ON TAKEOVERS
HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR
THERE'S A LOT BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS
THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS
MOBIL BASED IN NEW YORK SAID ITS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME JUMPED NINETY TWO PERCENT
THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL TO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT TO REPLY
ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
WHEN MRS. HIGA TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX FROZEN PIZZA WAS STILL A LONG SHOT
THE AVERAGE JAPANESE DIDN'T HAVE FREEZER SPACE LET ALONE AN OVEN

SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
A LOSS WASN'T EXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR
INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH <NOISE> A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS S:AID MESSRS.
SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
CANDICE BERGEN AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM
I OFTEN THINK OBSERVED MS. BERGEN THAT IF DOSTOEVSKI HAD BEEN A SINGER HE'D HAVE SOUNDED LIKE RAY CHARLES
THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS <NOISE>
IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT IN TWENTY TWELVE
MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE TO BE NO BIDS AT ALL
<NOISE> THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY
HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
WE'LL SEE
WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
<NOISE> SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
BUT THERE'S A NEED FOR CLARITY
THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
THIS PROVISION WON'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY

COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION HAS ROLLED TWO CLUB CARS INTO TOWN TO ENTERTAIN DEMOCRATS
THE COMPANY IS HEADED BY DREW LEWIS FREQUENTLY A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE REPUBLICANS
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR ALTERNATES TO THIS CONVENTION
DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SENT WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID
INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS

BUT TYCO'S DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS LAUNCH IS UNUSUAL
THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF THE TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW
<NOISE> NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
THE BANK OF ITALY ALSO REPORTEDLY SOLD MARKS TO BUY ITALIAN LIRE
THE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MAINLY AT DEFENDING THE SAGGING LIRA IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH EIGHT EUROPEAN CURRENCIES FLOAT WITHIN SPECIFIED LIMITS
BUT THEY ALSO HAD THE EFFECT OF HELPING THE DOLLAR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF MARKS IN THE MARKET
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT WHICH LIKE MR. KIRK RELISHES AN EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE THE OIL SPILL HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF ATTENTION

I RESENT THOSE STATEMENTS
MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OUTSTANDING IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY ONE
ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS

<NOISE> THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
<NOISE> A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
<NOISE> WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
<NOISE> I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW <NOISE> ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY

<NOISE> BEFORE FRIDAY <NOISE> IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
<NOISE> THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER <NOISE> WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT

G. M. WHICH HAS LOST ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE U. S. CAR MARKET IN RECENT YEARS FIGURES THE GAMES' LATE SEPTEMBER TIMING IS IDEAL
IT ALSO HOPES THE GAMES WILL ATTRACT UPSCALE VIEWERS WHO NORMALLY DON'T TUNE INTO SPORTS
DURING THAT CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES <NOISE> A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED <NOISE> FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES

<NOISE> THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED

THE REACTION FROM THE FREE WORLD SHE WROTE AND THE LEADERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN LITTLE
THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES

ANALYST THOMAS ROONEY OF DONALDSON LUFKIN AND JENRETTE GOT SCORES OF CALLS FROM CLIENTS ABOUT THE RUMORS
HE ESTIMATES PRIME'S DOMESTIC BUSINESS MAY BE OFF TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WITH FOREIGN SALES UP BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
DOMESTIC SALES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF PRIME'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REVENUE
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING

SO IS SUPPORT FOR A BEEFED UP TEAM OF DEAL MAKERS TO BROKER MERGERS AMONG CALIFORNIA COMPANIES
NONE OF THESE AREAS HOWEVER HOLD THE PROSPECT OF QUICK GROWTH
SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS

SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.

THE BULLS ARGUE HOWEVER THAT SELLERS ARE LEAVING THE PARTY TOO SOON
FOR ONE THING THEY SAY THE LARGE PREMIUM INCREASES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO APPEAR IN INSURERS' BOTTOM LINES
FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EARNINGS GAINS OF TWENTY FIVE TO MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS ARE ALMOST A CERTAINTY AT THESE COMPANIES
AND MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE EARNINGS GROWTH TO CONTINUE ALBEIT AT A MORE MODEST RATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET
TO GET AROUND THAT REQUIREMENT INSURERS CAN PAY A REINSURER TO ASSUME PART OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THE ANNUITY IN RETURN FOR PART OF THE PREMIUM

THE KROH BROTHERS MISMANAGED BUT IT WAS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LINING THEIR OWN POCKETS HE SAYS

BOSTON BASED FIDELITY THIS YEAR BECAME THE LARGEST MUTUAL FUND GROUP IN THE U. S.
IT TRADITIONALLY HAS SOLD ITS FUNDS THROUGH DIRECT MARKETING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE ADVERTISING BACKED BY A TELEPHONE NETWORK

<NOISE> THE UNION SAID THE WORKERS' COMPLAINTS PERSUADED IT TO PLACE A TEAM OF ORGANIZERS IN SMYRNA LAST JULY
IT HAS STARTED COLLECTING SUPPORT CARDS FROM EMPLOYEES AND IF THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PLANT'S THIRTY TWO HUNDRED WORKERS SIGN UP THE UNION CAN REQUEST AN ELECTION
MR. BIEBER SAID THE UNION HASN'T SET A DEADLINE TO COMPLETE THE DRIVE
AFTER COLLECTING THE SIGNATURES THE U. A. W. CAN ASK NISSAN TO RECOGNIZE THE UNION WITHOUT AN ELECTION ALTHOUGH ACQUIESCENCE BY NISSAN ISN'T CONSIDERED LIKELY
EVENTUALLY THOUGH SHE BURNED OUT ON BODY BUILDING
IT WAS OBSESSIVE IT WAS UNHEALTHY SHE RECALLS
I LEARNED THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO BE SO COMPULSIVE
YOU CAN DO IT IN SMALL SESSIONS
NOW I ONLY GO INTO THE GYM TWICE A WEEK AND IT'S LIKE RECESS THE FAVORITE PART OF MY DAY NOT AN INTRUSION ON MY LIFE
ANOTHER LESSON SHE CAME AWAY WITH IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT IS IRRELEVANT IN TERMS OF EXERCISING
GOOD TECHNIQUE HOLDING THE CONTRACTION THAT'S THE PUREST DEFINITION OF EXERCISE HOW MANY MUSCLE FIBERS CAN YOU EXPLODE

IN ADDITION TO TREATING FRACTURES THE DEVICES ARE USED TO TREAT DISORDERS WHERE SURGERY HAS FAILED AND FOR CERTAIN *CONGENITAL* DI- DISORDERS THE COMPANY SAID
BUT SOME ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALISTS DON'T THINK THE DEVICES WORK THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGED
THE FOUR OH DECISION IS A SECOND VICTORY FOR BROADCASTERS PROMOTING A NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED HIGH DEFINITION TELEVISION
THOSE BROADCASTERS HAVE ARGUED THAT THEY WILL NEED ADDITIONAL TELEVISION FREQUENCIES TO TRANSMIT HIGH DEFINITION PICTURES
<NOISE> BUT MOBILE RADIO COMPANIES HAVE URGED THE F. C. C. TO REALLOCATE THE FREQUENCIES FOR SUCH USES AS POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT RADIO
THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT IS AN INTERIM ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE TWO SIDES DRAW UP A FULL DEBT RESTRUCTURING FOR BRAZIL BY AROUND THE END OF THE YEAR
BRAZIL ALSO WOULD BE REQUIRED TO AGREE ON AN ECONOMIC PROGRAM WITH THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ANY AGREEMENT WITH THE I. M. F. IS LIKELY TO PROVOKE STRONG OPPOSITION IN BRAZIL WHERE THE FUND IS LOATHED FOR PROMOTING AUSTERITY
AND THERE IS SPECULATION THAT MR. BRESSER MAY RESIGN OR ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE OUSTED AS A SACRIFICE FOR SECURING AN I. M. F. PROGRAM

COMMERCE UNDER SECRETARY SAYS DOLLAR IS NOW COMPETITIVE A NEWS MONITOR REPORTS
<NOISE> THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S A COST SAVINGS SAID A SPOKESWOMAN FOR EASTERN ALTHOUGH SHE COULDN'T SAY HOW MUCH IT IS *PROJECTED* TO BE
BUT THERE'S ALSO A TREND HERE
EATING TRENDS HAVE CHANGED AND WE FIND THERE IS GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF COLD MEALS
A MERGER WITH MACY WHICH IS ROUGHLY HALF THE SIZE OF FEDERATED COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE LARGER RETAILER'S EXECUTIVES
MACY'S SMALLER SIZE COULD LEAVE FEDERATED'S OFFICERS WITH OPERATING POWER IN A COMBINED CONCERN
AND FEELINGS AT FEDERATED HAVE RUN HIGH AGAINST CAMPEAU WHICH SURPRISED THE COMPANY WITH A HOSTILE BID LAST MONTH
HOWEVER CAMPEAU'S BID IS ALL CASH AND THE MACY BID ISN'T
THE PROPOSED MERGER OF COMEX AND THE RIVAL NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE IS A BIG ISSUE HOWEVER
NYMEX HAS PUT MERGER TALKS ON HOLD UNTIL IT SEES WHO THE NEW COMEX CHAIRMAN IS
WE CAN'T CONTINUE AS A METALS EXCHANGE
WE MUST EXPAND THROUGH MERGER MR. HANEMANN SAYS
MR. GARVEY DOESN'T STRESS A NYMEX MERGER NEARLY AS MUCH AS HIS OPPONENT BUT SAYS HE'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN FAVOR OF MERGER
THE FED WILL REMAIN VIGILANT AGAINST A RE ACCELERATION OF INFLATION MR. JOHNSON VOWED
HE ADDED THOUGH I AM REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE INFLATION OUTLOOK
WAGE INCREASES HAVE REMAINED MODERATE AND GIVEN THE RECENT SOFTNESS IN OIL PRICES ENERGY PRICES SHOULD PUT A DAMPER ON CONSUMER AND PRODUCER PRICE INCREASES
IN AN AWKWARD REMINDER OF THE BOOM DAYS SHEARSON'S NEW LONDON HEADQUARTERS FACES AN ICE SKATING RINK BUILT JUST TO GIVE THE COMPLEX MORE GRANDEUR

IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT A SHEARSON OFFICIAL BITTERLY REMARKS
UNDERNEATH THE SKATING RINK IS A GYMNASIUM SHEARSON IS TRYING TO SELL
DAN QUAYLE CARED DEEPLY EVEN THOUGH THIS DID NOT CONCERN HIS CONSTITUENTS ANY MORE THAN IT DID OTHER AMERICANS
EVEN THOUGH PRESERVING CONVENTIONALLY ARMED G. L. C. M.S GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILES IS HARDLY A POPULAR RALLYING CRY
EVEN THOUGH THE ISSUE CONCERNED FUTURE SECURITY RATHER THAN TODAY'S SAFETY
AND EVEN THOUGH HE OPPOSED THE DECISION OF A PRESIDENT HE ALWAYS SOUGHT TO SUPPORT
THESE ARE THE TRAITS THAT I RESPECT IN HIM AND ON WHICH WE HAVE BUILT A WARM PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP OVER THE YEARS
MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
<NOISE> NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
<NOISE> IN WASHINGTON SOMEONE WHO GETS CUT OFF AT THE KNEES CAN NEVER COME BACK
POOR JOHN TOWER CAN'T COME BACK
IF HE HAD BEEN THE HEAD OF A WALL STREET FIRM THAT WENT BUST HE COULD RETURN
FRANK ROBINSON THE HALL OF FAME HITTER WHO'S THE O.'S MANAGER TAKES A LIKE TACK
WE'RE NO POWERHOUSE BUT WE'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES SAYS HE
IF WE CAN KEEP THAT UP WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
DOING EVERYTHING PEOPLE WANT THE F. D. A. TO DO WOULD REQUIRE AN F. D. A. THE SIZE OF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT HE SAYS
BUT OVER THE LAST DECADE THE AGENCY HAS INSTEAD SHRUNK TO SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES FROM EIGHTY ONE HUNDRED
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING A BUDGET AUTHORIZATION OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE
FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
<NOISE> AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORPORATION A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFER
HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
INTEREST RATES WERE MIXED ON NEW SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REGULAR WEEKLY AUCTION YESTERDAY
THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW THIRTEEN WEEK TREASURY BILLS ROSE TO FIVE POINT EIGHT ONE PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT AT LAST WEEK'S SALE
THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW TWENTY SIX WEEK BILLS FELL TO SIX POINT ONE PERCENT FROM SIX POINT ONE EIGHT PERCENT THE PREVIOUS WEEK
JUNE'S LOAD FACTOR OR PERCENTAGE OF SEATS FILLED TOTALED SIXTY FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT RANKING CONTINENTAL NEAR THE BOTTOM OF MAJOR U. S. AIRLINES
THE FIGURE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAY'S LOW LEVEL OF SIXTY POINT ONE PERCENT BUT TRAILED THE SIXTY FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF A YEAR EARLIER
FOR THE MONTH CONTINENTAL FLEW THREE POINT THREE BILLION REVENUE PASSENGER MILES A NINETY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION MILES A YEAR EARLIER
A REVENUE PASSENGER MILE IS ONE PAYING PASSENGER FLOWN ONE MILE
THE INCREASE REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION WITH PEOPLE EXPRESS
THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET IS AWASH WITH LIQUIDITY MR. GRANT SAYS
BUT IN JUNE SUDDENLY WITH NO APPARENT DRAINAGE IT WENT DOWN AND KEPT GOING DOWN HE SAYS
WHAT IS A MYSTERY TO MR. GRANT AND MANY OTHERS IS THAT THE TOKYO MARKET HAS SINCE STAGED A VIGOROUS REBOUND
A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS
THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS ZERO POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES
THE NOTES ARE RATED DOUBLE A. THREE BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED AND DOUBLE A. MINUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION
IF ITS MAVERICK STRATEGY WORKS SECURITY PACIFIC WILL BE SHOWING ANOTHER WAY BESIDES ACQUISITIONS FOR SUPERREGIONAL BANKS TO GROW
THESE BANKS' MANAGERS INCLUDING MR. FLAMSON PLAN TO EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE THE BIG NEW YORK BANKS AS NATIONAL GIANTS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
BOLSTERED BY STRONG EQUITY CAPITAL POSITIONS SUPERREGIONALS ALREADY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN MONEY CENTER INSTITUTIONS
PASSAGE OF THE KENNEDY MARKEY BILL OR SIMILAR GRANTS OF MORAL RIGHTS WOULD ENRICH ESTABLISHED ARTISTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR STRUGGLING COMPETITORS
IN ADDITION THE THEORY OF MORAL RIGHTS IS BOTH PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTENABLE AND AN INVITATION TO AN ORGY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL CONFUSION
CONGRESS SHOULD REFUSE TO GRANT ARTISTS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND SHOULD REFUSE TO SIGN THE BERN CONVENTION
THEY CLASSIFIED EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY AS RACIST OR SEXIST SAYS MR. SCHAUB <NOISE>
WHERE'S THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY
BEATS US
BUT IF YOU FIND A COLLEGE ADMINISTRATOR WHO ISN'T COWERING FROM THE NEW ORTHODOXY LET US KNOW
SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
BY CONTRACTING OUT PRODUCTION TO AMERICAN PLANTS THEY ARE SAVING MORE THAN A DIME PER CAN OF DRINK
THEIR NEXT LOGICAL STEP ANALYSTS SAY WILL BE TO ACQUIRE U. S. SOFT DRINK CONCERNS
EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT EVEN BREAK INTO THE ENORMOUS U. S. MARKET
AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
THE PLOT IS A TRUE LIFE TALE OF M. C. A. ITSELF AND THE ENDING HAS YET TO BE PLAYED OUT
BUT THE REVELATIONS HAVE ALREADY RAISED EYEBROWS IN HOLLYWOOD WHERE M. C. A. IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE BEDROCK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
M. C. A. HAD TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE LAST YEAR OWNS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND IS A TELEVISION MUSIC AND REAL ESTATE GIANT
THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY WRONGDOING BUT RECENT PUBLICITY ABOUT ITS TANGLE OF BUSINESS DEALINGS THREATENS AT THE VERY LEAST TO SULLY ITS REPUTATION
EDUCATION IS THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH STUDYING A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS TO GAIN INFORMATION AND THE DEXTERITY TO USE YOUR WITS AND YOUR EXPRESSION
EDUCATION PREPARES YOU TO BE SOMEONE MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING
EDUCATION IS WHAT PREPARES YOU TO HEAR MORE WHEN YOU LISTEN TO REACH DEEPER WHEN YOU THINK TO SAY MORE WHEN YOU SPEAK
MOST UNUSUALLY THIS TIME AROUND THE CYCLICAL CLIMB IN PLANT USAGE HASN'T YET OCCURRED
AS THE EXPANSION KEEPS ROLLING HOWEVER THIS IS EXPECTED TO COME
WHEN IT DOES FORECASTERS LOOK FOR BRISKER CAPITAL SPENDING AS WELL REGARDLESS OF THE NEW TAX RULES
IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SPOKESMAN
STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIKELY
THE SINGAPORE ECONOMY AFTER ITS FIRST DOWNTURN IN NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IS ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ANALYSTS SAY
AFTER CONTRACTING ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE ISLAND'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GREW ONE POINT NINE PERCENT LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INITIAL ESTIMATES
EXPANSION OF THREE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT IS PREDICTED FOR THIS YEAR
THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER
TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT OVER SALARIES THEY PUT HER FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND LIVE OFF HIS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME
I LOOK AT IT AS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE MADE TOGETHER SAYS MR. STEPHENS
BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISKS PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING
NO LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS CAN MAKE A NUCLEAR FACILITY SAFE UNLESS IT HAS GOOD MANAGEMENT THE N. R. C. TOLD CONGRESS LAST YEAR <NOISE>
INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS
IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF ITS PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS
UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
ARE THE DANES SUPPOSED TO LISTEN SERIOUSLY TO SECRETARY SHULTZ WHEN HE TELLS THEM THAT THE PROPOSED DANISH POLICY TOWARD SHIPS UNDERCUTS THE NUCLEAR DETERRENCE OF NATO
WASN'T MR. SHULTZ JUST IN MOSCOW WORKING ON YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR TREATY
HAVEN'T AMERICAN DIPLOMATS AT NATO BEEN TELLING EVERYONE THAT COMPARED WITH THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF NOT RATIFYING THE TREATY THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF RATIFICATION WOULD BE MINIMAL
MANY FUND MANAGERS HERE SAY AMERICA ISN'T TAKING THE STRONG MEDICINE NEEDED TO CURB HIGH CONSUMER SPENDING IMPROVE LOW PERSONAL SAVINGS RATES AND COMBAT THE STUBBORN DUAL OF DEFICITS
THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY PROGRESS BEFORE THE NEW U. S. PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR AND SAY BOTH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES PROBABLY WILL RISE
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION
MR. KAVNER SAID THE RIVAL GROUP LACKS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DIFFERENCES
IN ADDITION HE SAID A. T. AND T. SPENDS FAR MORE EACH YEAR ON DEVELOPING UNIX THAN THE OPEN SOFTWARE FOUNDATION HAS INDICATED IT WILL SPEND <NOISE>
HE ADDED THAT A. T. AND T. PLANS TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS UNIX ANY USEFUL FEATURES FROM ITS RIVALS' VERSION
AND MR. WATT IS ECSTATIC
YOU CAN TEACH WHOLE HISTORY LESSONS FROM THIS VILLAGE INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE SOCIOLOGY AND ART HE SAYS
THESE WEALTHY LANDLORDS GOT BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL AND THAT LED TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE HAN EMPIRE
THE OWNERS BECAME POWERFUL LORDS AND THE GUARDS IN THE TOWERS BECAME PRIVATE ARMIES
RICK BRIGGS PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID FALCONBRIDGE'S LATEST PROPOSALS ON CONTRACTING OUT ARE NOT ENCOURAGING
THE PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED YESTERDAY AFTER A TWO DAY RECESS IN THE TALKS
ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF FALCONBRIDGE'S NICKEL OUTPUT COMES FROM ITS SUDBURY OPERATIONS
DETAILS ARE STILL MURKY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CREDITS
ITALIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT ROME'S DECISION TO GRANT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GUARANTEE OF EXPORT CREDITS WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A BANKING DECISION
BRITAIN'S MIDLAND BANK HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A NUMBER ONE BILLION CREDIT LINE THOUGH SOME BRITISH BANKS MAY BE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT PARTICIPATING
FRENCH BANKS HAVE YET TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS OFFICIALLY BUT ARE SAID TO BE CONSIDERING LOANS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS
THE FED REPORT GAVE NO HINT THAT MAKERS OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT EXPECT DEMAND FOR THEIR WARES TO FALL OFF
PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT THOUGH REDUCED BY THE DROP IN AUTO AND TRUCK PRODUCTION GREW ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT IN JULY AFTER REMAINING FLAT IN JUNE
THE FED ATTRIBUTED THE INCREASE TO STEPPED UP PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND FACTORY EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT
OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ALSO REBOUNDED IN JULY AFTER DROPPING FOR TWO MONTHS
IT'S KIND OF LIKE EATING PEANUTS ISN'T IT SAID MR. MURPHY
ONCE YOU START IT'S TOUGH TO STOP
THE UMPTEENTH SOUND OF LEAD SMACKING METAL AND A RIFLE BEING COCKED SERVED AS A QUICK ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
WITH THE SPEAKER BEHIND IT GEPHARDT WILL PASS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR SAID REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PEASE DEMOCRAT OHIO
ADDED REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DONNELLY DEMOCRAT MASSACHUSETTS ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE
HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY UNLESS HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A PROVISION LIKE GEPHARDT
ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
IF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WILL BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
THE UNION SAID THE ENGINEERS WERE LEAVING THEIR VESSELS WHEN THEY DOCKED
LATE YESTERDAY NINETEEN SHIPS WERE REPORTED TO BE TIED UP BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE
THE UNION WHICH REPRESENTS ENGINEERS ON ABOUT EIGHTY GREAT LAKES SHIPS HAS BEEN WITHOUT A CONTRACT SINCE MAY THIRTY FIRST
THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE ANALYSTS
IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
AS OF APRIL FIRST ALL INTEREST INCOME WILL BE TAXED AT TWENTY PERCENT
EXEMPTIONS INCLUDE SINGLE MOTHERS THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD
OTHER EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING AND PENSIONS
THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
MR. HOWARD NOT ONLY HELPED THE FLEDGLING PUBLIC COMPANIES DRUM UP INTEREST IN THEIR SHARES HE HELPED INVEST THE CAPITAL THEY RAISED IN THE PUBLIC OFFERINGS
IN MANY CASES THE BANKS HE ADVISED INVESTED LARGE AMOUNTS IN EACH OTHER
AND THEY LENT FUNDS TO OTHER CLIENTS OF MR. HOWARD WHO SOMETIMES INVESTS IN THE SAME STOCKS
ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC HURT THE CHAIN
THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
HOWEVER FRIENDLY'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRETAX OPERATING PROFIT OF FORTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BURMESE MARCHED IN RANGOON AND FOURTEEN OTHER CITIES TO PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW LEADER SEIN LWIN
STATE RUN RADIO MONITORED IN BANGKOK REPORTED VIOLENT INCIDENTS IN MANDALAY
DIPLOMATS SAID AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE PROTESTS
STUDENTS BUDDHIST MONKS AND OTHERS PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS
WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS
SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE SWANSON COMPANY BEGAN SELLING FROZEN POT PIES TURKEY CHICKEN AND MEAT
THE FIRST PRODUCTION ORDER CALLED FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PIES
SOON IT WAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY
BY NINETEEN FIFTY THREE CLARKE AND HIS BROTHER WERE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP COMPLETE FROZEN DINNERS
THOUSANDS OF AZERBAIJAN WORKERS RALLIED IN THE SOVIET REPUBLIC'S CAPITAL BAKU AFTER A DAY OF WORK STOPPAGES TO BACK DEMANDS FOR GREATER LOCAL AUTONOMY
IN ESTONIA THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF URGED ETHNIC RUSSIAN WORKERS TO END A SIX DAY STRIKE OVER A NEW LAW TIGHTENING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
<NOISE> FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
<NOISE> THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFER
<NOISE> HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
<NOISE> STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
<NOISE> MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS <NOISE>
SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
<NOISE> BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION <NOISE> EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND AND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED
IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
<NOISE> COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY ONE PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
<NOISE> WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL THE ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INC.
AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
CONGRESS'S JOINT TAX COMMITTEE NOW IS WITHOUT A STAFF CHIEF
<NOISE> DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICE OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
<NOISE> IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF A TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INC. AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
<NOISE> HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAYS BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
<NOISE> AND HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENTED SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE <NOISE> AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
THE RECURRING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HANDS ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
<NOISE> MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY <NOISE> AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT <NOISE>
BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
<NOISE> THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES THE X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
<NOISE> HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED ON IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID

UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION

FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAYS SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD <NOISE> THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
<NOISE> IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS SOGGY AND MOLDY
WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE

THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
<NOISE> WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS <NOISE> INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
<NOISE> THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
<NOISE> THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER

<NOISE> IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS <NOISE> WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
<NOISE> A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME

HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED

I'M HOPING WE GET A PRESIDENT WHO CLEANS OUT AMERICA
DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
<NOISE> ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COST EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY THAT MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY <NOISE> AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
<NOISE> BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
<NOISE> THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETY ONE HE SAID
<NOISE> ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A HIGHLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD <NOISE> AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL <NOISE> OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE <NOISE> MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS

<NOISE> HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION <NOISE> OF FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS PER TON PROFIT
TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
<NOISE> BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION <NOISE> AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS

<NOISE> ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP JU(ST)- FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET TO THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. TO E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS <NOISE> HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GROUP ON THE CONTINENT
NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
<NOISE> BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE

WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT OH TWO BILLION DOLLARS <NOISE> FROM THE TEN POINT TWO FOUR BILLION ORIGINALLY REPORTED
SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH <NOISE> POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
<NOISE> <NOISE> IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
<NOISE> WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
<NOISE> THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
<NOISE> IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
<NOISE> MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
<NOISE> IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE

COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSITIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE A- TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
<NOISE> ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
<NOISE> THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
HOWEVER RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING

<NOISE> THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA <NOISE>
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
<NOISE> A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
<NOISE> HERE ARE A FEW HARD EARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE <NOISE>
BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND UPON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
<NOISE> THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
<NOISE> AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD <NOISE> WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
<NOISE> THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE
JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR V.
MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT <NOISE> WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY THAT STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS

IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCK:S WOULD MOVE HIGHER

<NOISE> WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IS STILL CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOWING GROWTH
FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
<NOISE> THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESS REPORTING TO HIM

THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
THUS INSTEAD OF *CALMAT'S* BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
MR. CHATIHACHI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER A:T ALL THIS WEEK
THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY TWO GROUPS WHICH CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME

BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE STILL WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY

MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS

THE WORD IS TERROR

PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
<NOISE> I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY

BUT SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT S. H. V.'S INTENTIONS
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SAID HUMPHREY HARRISON AN ANALYST AT COUNTY SECURITIES
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE END GAME IS BUT I DOUBT THEY S. H. V. WILL REMAIN AT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT

NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
<NOISE> BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION

THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
<NOISE> WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE
A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE

<NOISE> THE COMPANY PROJECTED SALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IN NINETEEN AND EIGHTY NINE OF FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER <NOISE> WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
YESTERDAY THE AGENCY REVERSED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FINDING THAT MEREDITH HAD VIOLATED THE DOCTRINE
THE SO CALLED FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS A MISNOMER SAID DIANE KILLORY THE AGENCY'S GENERAL COUNSEL
IT PROMOTES BLANDNESS AND NOTHINGNESS BY CHILLING THE VERY SPEECH IT WAS MEANT TO FOSTER
IN SOME SECTORS THOUGH INTRIGUING OPTIONS ARE SPRINGING UP
INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR MAJOR BROKERAGES SCREEN MONEY MANAGERS FOR POTENTIAL CLIENTS
SEVERAL HAVE CREATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT POOL THE MONEY OF INVESTORS WITH SIMILAR INVESTMENT GOALS
THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE THEN MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID <NOISE>
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
<NOISE> TREASURYS WON'T RESUME TRADING UNTIL THE TOKYO MARKET OPENS MONDAY
<NOISE> THIS SOME ANALYSTS SAY MAY MEAN THAT THE LONDON MARKET REACTION WILL BE CONFINED <NOISE> TO A BRIEF ADJUSTMENT AT THE OPENING
NEVERTHELESS TRADERS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE NEUTRAL POSITIONS THROUGH THE WEEKEND JUST IN CASE THE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST DATA PRODUCE A NASTY SURPRISE

<NOISE> THE SUIT CHARGES <NOISE> THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
THE FRANCHISEES FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR C. B. S. SAID THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHILE OPERATING IN A VERY DEMANDING ECONOMIC CLIMATE
<NOISE> WE'RE CONTINUING TO BARGAIN
CAPITAL CITIES /SLASH A. B. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TALKS
WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID

<NOISE> HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG
<NOISE> IN A LEVERAGED BUYOUT A GROUP OF INVESTORS BUYS A COMPANY AND TAKES IT PRIVATE USING MOSTLY BORROWED FUNDS TO FINANCE THE TRANSACTION
CASH FLOW AND OFTEN ASSET VALUES ARE USED TO PAY DOWN THE DEBT
FOR INVESTORS THE APPEAL IS THE PROSPECT OF A BIG RETURN WHEN THE RESTRUCTURED COMPANY IS REFINANCED OR SOLD IN A FEW YEARS
BURLINGTON ALSO HAS BEEN MOVING AGGRESSIVELY IN COURT TO COUNTER THE HOSTILE BID
<NOISE> YESTERDAY IT FILED ITS SECOND LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GROUP AND DISCLOSED THAT IT MAY TURN THE TABLES AND SEEK TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF MONTREAL BASED DOMINION
<NOISE> THE PAC MAN DEFENSE IS NAMED AFTER THE VIDEO GAME IN WHICH A PLAYER TRIES TO GOBBLE UP HIS FOE BEFORE THE PLAYER IS SWALLOWED
<NOISE> A. :COLON THE PRESS ASSERTS THIS ALL THE TIME AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
I MUST SAY I HAVE NOT YET FOUND THAT THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE PROBLEM
I MEAN THE EUROPEAN BANKS HAVE BEEN BETTER RESERVED THAN WE FOR A LONG TIME
<NOISE> IT HASN'T SEEMED TO AFFECT THE DIALOGUE ALL THAT MUCH
NUCLEAR POWER REMAINS TODAY FRAUGHT WITH POTENTIAL FOR GREAT DANGER TO HUMAN LIFE MR. MIKVA WROTE
CONGRESS THUS LIMITED THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMISSION IN CARRYING OUT THE MANDATE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
CONGRESS LEFT NO ROOM FOR THE COMMISSION WHEN OPERATING WITHIN THIS SPHERE TO USE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
ALSO PROVIDING MORE SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS
THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS
THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS
INSTEAD DAYTON HUDSON'S EARNINGS HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED MORE THAN A YEAR BY MERCHANDISING PROBLEMS IN ITS MERVYN'S DEPARTMENT STORE UNIT
ANALYSTS SAID THE TROUBLE STARTED WITH MERVYN'S CONCENTRATING TOO MUCH ON OPENING NEW STORES <NOISE> AND NOT ENOUGH ON PROVIDING BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE
TOP MANAGEMENT WAS SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEMS SOME ANALYSTS SAID
AND MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN TOO OPTIMISTIC IN PREDICTING THE TIMING OF A TURNAROUND THE ANALYSTS SAID
WALL STREET IN GENERAL HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT G. M. IN RECENT WEEKS BECAUSE OF ITS NEW LABOR CONTRACT
THE THREE YEAR PACT INCLUDES A JOB SECURITY PROGRAM THAT PREVENTS LAYOFFS EXCEPT DURING A SALES DROP PREVENTS PLANT CLOSINGS AND SLOWS ATTRITION
MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE PROVISIONS WILL HAMPER G. M.'S EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE OPERATIONS AND SHED UNCOMPETITIVE PLANTS PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OPERATIONS
<NOISE> DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
<NOISE> B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER <NOISE> WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE

<NOISE> FOR HIS AMNESTY APPLICATION MR. CALDERA NEEDS THE BOSS'S SIGNATURE TO HELP PROVE THAT HE HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR AT LEAST NINETY DAYS
ACTUALLY MR. CALDERA HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS
THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
<NOISE> THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
NEW YORK WOULD ALSO HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
<NOISE> THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS
NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
BORG WARNER EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO FORTY ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS ON SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SHARES
MINSTAR AND BEAR STEARNS ENTERED INTO AN OPTION AGREEMENT FOR THE POSSIBLE PURCHASE OF THREE MILLION TWENTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BORG WARNER SHARES
THE PURCHASES WOULD BOOST MINSTAR'S BORG WARNER STAKE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT
YESTERDAY G. A. F. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS REQUIRED <NOISE> NINE POINT NINE SIX PERCENT INVESTMENT STAKE IN BORG WARNER
LAST MONTH PIEDMONT'S BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY ACCEPT N- NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY FOR SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
NORFOLK SOUTHERN HAS HAD A STAKE IN PIEDMONT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
BUT ONE DAY AFTER THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION U. S. AIR SWEETENED ITS INITIAL BID FOR PIEDMONT FORCING THE BOARD TO DROP ITS RECOMMENDATION
IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
<NOISE> DURING TESTIMONY IN APRIL FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DANIEL OLIVER SAID THE LEGISLATION WOULD RESTRAIN COMPETITION
HE ARGUED THAT SELLING DRUGS POSES NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR PHYSICIANS
THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS URGED STATE LEGISLATURES TO OPPOSE SIMILAR MEASURES
WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
AND MR. SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW AND WAITING
BOND TRADERS WERE ALSO CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS
THE DROP HAS INDICATED TO SOME ANALYSTS THAT INFLATION FEARS WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
PREVIOUSLY OIL PRICES HAD SURGED ABOVE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL LARGELY ON FEAR THAT GROWING TENSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF <NOISE> MIGHT LEAD TO A S- DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES
<NOISE> IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFECTIONS FROM HILL SAMUEL'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MEMBER CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP <NOISE> ACCORDING TO INSIDERS AND OFFICIALS OF OTHER BANKS
AS PART OF T. S. B. THE DEPARTMENT MAINLY WOULD SERVE SMALL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
MANY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM HAD SOUGHT AN ALLIANCE WITH A LARGER GLOBAL PARTNER
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAD THOUGHT THE OPERATION WOULD BE SOLD TO BARCLAYS BANK P. L. C.
PROTESTERS IN BANGLADESH FOUGHT POLICE AND POLITICAL OPPONENTS AFTER VOTING RESUMED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS
FOUR PEOPLE WERE REPORTED KILLED AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED WERE INJURED
THE VOTING FOR LOCAL COUNCIL SEATS BEGAN FEBRUARY TENTH BUT ELECTION A- VIOLENCE KILLED AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND OFFICIALS POSTPONED THE BALLOTING
<NOISE> VOTING HAD RESUMED ON SATURDAY
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW PORING OVER SEOW'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS ASKING HOW HE'S BEEN PAYING HIS PHONE BILLS THESE PAST TEN YEARS
SIMILAR INQUIRIES LED TO THE EXPULSION FROM PARLIAMENT LAST DECEMBER OF JOSHUA B. JEYARETNAM LEAVING ONLY ONE OPPOSITION M. P.
<NOISE> A TEAM CANDIDATE PROPOSAL NOW UNDER STUDY WOULD ALSO SEEM LIKELY TO KEEP THE OPPOSITION FROM FINDING ITS WAY INTO GOVERNMENT OFFICE
BUT SINGAPORE'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION CITIZENS AREN'T LIKELY TO BENEFIT QUITE SO MUCH AS THE POLITICIANS OF MR. LEE'S RULING PARTY
COTTON FUTURES PRICES FOR COTTON FROM THE CURRENT CROP ROSE ON BUYING MOSTLY BY TRADERS WHO FOLLOW CHART SIGNALS
THE ADVANCE IN TURN PULLED UP PRICES OF DELIVERY MONTHS REPRESENTING THE NEW CROP SEASON WHICH WILL BEGIN AUGUST THE FIRST
THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIFTY NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FORTY EIGHT CENTS
THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP ZERO POINT FIFTY EIGHT CENT TO SIXTY POINT THIRTY SIX CENTS A POUND
ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED
BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE
HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE
HIS WEAPON THE PERSONAL BLESSING OF COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIYANG
AT THE APRIL OPENING OF THE F:IVE HUNDRED TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GUANGDONG POWER PLANT OFFICIALDOM HEAPED PRAISE ON MR. WU FOR BEATING A CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE
INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO EL- ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
<NOISE> BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
<NOISE> OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE <NOISE>
<NOISE> THE MINE IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE BETWEEN W- THIRTEEN MILLION AND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF STEAMING COAL ANNUALLY USED AT ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS SAYS MR. OGDEN
ALL BUT TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT MOSTLY TO JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND HONG KONG
SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
THE BRODERICK MEN ARE ATTRACTED TO LEAH BECAUSE SHE IS AN HONEST WOMAN IN A WORLD OF PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE
<NOISE> SHE CAN MANIPULATE IDEOLOGY AND IMAGE TO FURTHER RADICAL CAUSES BUT SHE DOESN'T CONFUSE HER POLITICAL STRATAGEMS WITH REALITY
<NOISE> INDEED SHE HAS NO PERSONAL DEVOTION TO THOSE CAUSES THEY ARE SIMPLY VEHICLES FOR HER PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
THIS FASCINATES AND BAFFLES THE MEN AROUND HER
ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
<NOISE> ALTHOUGH OPEC HAS TOYED WITH VOLUNTARY QUOTAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IT REALLY DIDN'T BECOME SERIOUS ABOUT PRODUCTION CURBS UNTIL AFTER LAST YEAR'S COLLAPSE IN OIL PRICES
<NOISE> MEMBER COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO ARGUE HOWEVER OVER THE FAIRNESS OF THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN QUOTAS AND EACH HAS REASON TO REPORT LESS THAN IT IS PRODUCING
<NOISE> THE PROBLEM SAYS A SENIOR OPEC OFFICIAL IS THAT RIGID QUOTAS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A FLEXIBLE OIL MARKET <NOISE>
WITH ONE EAR LAURA SLOATE LISTENS TO A MAN READING HEADLINES FROM SIX NEWSPAPERS
<NOISE> WITH THE OTHER EAR SHE MONITORS AN AIDE READING HER MAIL
MEANWHILE SHE IS KEEPING UP A CONVERSATION SORT OF
CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
<NOISE> THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID
<NOISE> IT WAS THROUGH THESE CORRESPONDENT BANKS THAT MANUFACTURERS GOT ALL OF THESE ENERGY LOANS THAT HAVE SOURED
HOWEVER ONE MANUFACTURERS EXECUTIVE SAID HE DOUBTED CORRESPONDENT BANKING WOULD BE ELIMINATED IN LIGHT OF THAT BUSINESS'S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RECENTLY
THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
<NOISE> IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
MR. SMITH SAID TRADING IN BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES WOULD RESUME EARLY TODAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
TRADING WAS SUSPENDED AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY PENCE OR SEVEN DOLLARS NINETY F:IVE CENTS WEDNESDAY
ANALYSTS PREDICTED EARLY YESTERDAY THAT THE SHARES WOULD FALL WHEN TRADING RESUMED WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE E. C. <NOISE> AND BRITISH GOVERNMENT
PROCESSORS BLAME THEIR SUPPLIERS
CARGILL INCORPORATED A MAJOR CORN SYRUP MAKER SAYS IT IS PAYING COOPERATIVES FARMERS AND ELEVATORS MORE FOR THEIR CORN
<NOISE> A SPOKESMAN SAYS SELLERS KNOW THEY CAN GO TO OTHER BUYERS
WE DON'T HAVE ANY GROWERS IN OUR POCKET
CARGILL CAN'T SET PRICES
AS FOR THE PRICES CARGILL CHARGES HE ADDS WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE MAXIMUM PRICE FOR OUR PRODUCTS ALL THE TIME
VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
THE COVERAGE BETWEEN ADS SOME COMPLAIN IS FRAGMENTED AND SHIFTY JUMPING TOO QUICKLY AMONG MYRIAD SPORTS
ACTUAL EVENTS AS OPPOSED TO TAPED PROFILES PREVIEWS AND REPORTS TAKE UP LESS THAN HALF OF THE AIRTIME
MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
<NOISE> <NOISE> IN PHILIPS SUN HAS WON A EUROPEAN ALLY THAT IT HOPES WILL PROVIDE AN EDGE OVER COMPETITORS
MOTOROLA INCORPORATED M. I. P. S. COMPUTER SYSTEMS INCORPORATED AND HEWLETT PACKARD COMPANY ARE JOCKEYING TO WOO COMPUTER MAKERS TO THEIR OWN R. I. S. C. <NOISE> CHIPS
THE CHIPS ARE RAPIDLY GAINING POPULARITY AMONG COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST CONVERTS COULD BECOME A DE FACTO STANDARD IN TOMORROW'S COMPUTER INDUSTRY
<NOISE> THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON A SEVEN TO SEVEN VOTE LAST MONTH EFFECTIVELY KILLED MR. LUCAS'S NOMINATION TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION
A MAJORITY WAS NEEDED TO SEND THE NOMINATION TO THE FULL SENATE
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT BUSH AND MR. THORNBURGH FOR NOMINATING MR. LUCAS WHO HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS A LAWYER AND NONE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATOR
<NOISE> THE LACK OF MARKET DEPTH YESTERDAY ENABLED SEVERAL LARGE BUY ORDERS TO SPARK THE DOLLAR RALLY
<NOISE> ONE NEW YORK TRADER SAID HE WITNESSED THE CURRENCY'S VALUE JUMP AS HIS BANK EXECUTED A PURCHASE ORDER FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SEVERAL CHUNKS
WHEN THERE ARE VERY FEW PLAYERS THAT KIND OF ORDER WILL MOVE THE MARKET SAID THE TRADER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
<NOISE> HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
HE ALSO IS FOCUSING ON EL HERALD
WITH ONLY TWO NEWS REPORTERS AND A DESK OF TRANSLATORS IT LACKS VITALITY READERS SAY
MR. CASTILLO WANTS TO EXPAND THE SECTION AND SELL IT AS AN INDEPENDENT PAPER
HE WILL BEGIN TESTING STAND ALONE SALES THIS MONTH
HE HAD A POINT
VITALY YURCHENKO OF THE K. G. B. THE MAN WHO HAD TOLD THE F. B. I. OF A SPY CODE NAMED MR.
LONG HAD BY THIS TIME DEFECTED BACK TO THE SOVIET UNION AND WAS IN MOSCOW
AND MR. PELTON HADN'T STOLEN ANY NATIONAL SECURI:TY AGENCY DOCUMENTS TO GIVE THE SOVIETS
OTHER ENTRANTS OFFER SUCH PEN NAMES AS GRANNY MR. DISCUSSION ANNA DARLING DEAR JOHN AND BEA READY
I SUGGEST A HIP MACHO NAME WITH QUICK READER IDENTIFICATION STAN LANDERS
I CAN PICTURE MY READERS IN A BAR AFTER WORK HEY DID YOU READ STAN THE MAN LANDERS THIS MORNING
THAT GUY GIVES GREAT ADVICE
<NOISE> RICHARD STEIN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FINANCE AT WORLDS OF WONDER SAID THE STOCK PROBABLY WAS MOVING DOWN IN SYMPATHY WITH OTHER TOY COMPANIES
HOWEVER HE SAID WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW TOY COMPANIES THAT EXPECT AN UP FOURTH QUARTER
HE SAID THE COMPANY IS EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS IN SALES OF TEDDY RUXPIN ITS TALKING TEDDY BEAR AND OF LASER TAG AN INFRARED GUN GAME
SOUNDS GOOD BUT WHAT'S THE CATCH
MR. LEMING A CHEMICALS ANALYST ISSUED HIS REPORT JUNE TWENTY SECOND WITH SEAGRAM TRADING AT SEVENTY SEVEN
<NOISE> IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTY SIX AND THREE EIGHTHS UP ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
THIS REASONING HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO GALVANIZE THE MARKET
<NOISE> MR. LEMING DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT YESTERDAY
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP <NOISE> AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
PIZZA HUT FOR EXAMPLE IS DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY PIE AND HAS INTRODUCED SEVERAL GOURMET PIZZAS
<NOISE> GODFATHER'S HAS INTRODUCED A LESS EXPENSIVE THIN CRUSTED PIE USED IN ITS TWO FOR ONE SPECIALS
IT DEVELOPED THE ECONOMY LINE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO CANNIBALIZE OUR PREMIUM PRODUCT SALES MR. HENDERSON SAYS
MR. FORBES SAID HE'D HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
<NOISE> I ASSURE YOU THAT FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
<NOISE> INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
<NOISE> MR. FORBES ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME
HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS
IN EFFECT THEY ALREADY ARE OPERATING AS IF IN A RECESSION SO LAYOFFS MIGHT PROVE RELATIVELY MODEST
IN ADDITION THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURING IN THE ECONOMY HAS FADED IN COMPARISON WITH THE GROWTH OF A RECESSION RESISTANT SERVICE JOBS
<NOISE> IN MOST MODERN NATIONS IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY WHEN CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE

<NOISE> AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
<NOISE> SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS

AS A RESULT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING

<NOISE> SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES

<NOISE> THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
<NOISE> IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS

<NOISE> THE DIVISION ARGUED THAT STOCK MANIPULATION OF THE KIND HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN WENT TO THE HEART OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
THE DIVISION ALSO SAID THE LAW DIRECTED THE S. E. C. TO ACT ON THE BELIEF THAT PAST MISCONDUCT RAISED A RISK OF FUTURE MISCONDUCT THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY EXPULSION
CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
<NOISE> ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS
THEY SAY THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO BOOST MEMBERSHIP IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH AIRLINES CONSIDER CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING BRAND LOYALTY

<NOISE> INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE <NOISE>
<NOISE> HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT

BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS

THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND ONE QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER
SINCE THEN THE STOCK HAS BEEN RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMORS
<NOISE> WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING <NOISE>

PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
<NOISE> THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS

<NOISE> FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE
<NOISE> HE ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO PICKED UP A BROOM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD STARTED CLEANING UP HE NOW GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE
THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
<NOISE> THE SIXTY THREE DOLLARS A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS

GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
<NOISE> AND REVENUES SLUMP
<NOISE> THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
<NOISE> INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION

<NOISE> IN AMSTERDAM STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN VOLATILE TRADING
<NOISE> SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID
VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION PRODUCED WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
<NOISE> RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
<NOISE> THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
<NOISE> THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
<NOISE> SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
<NOISE> THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
<NOISE> FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
<NOISE> IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
<NOISE> IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE <NOISE>
THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
<NOISE> THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
<NOISE> AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
<NOISE> IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
<NOISE> KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES

THE BUDGET HOWEVER WILL NOT MANAGE ITSELF
SOME WAY MUST BE FOUND TO PUT IT ON COURSE

SUCH A COMMISSION RESOLVED THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROBLEM EARLIER IN THIS DECADE
IN THE JOHNSON YEARS A COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS WERE THE MEANS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE BUDGET

THIS APPROACH ENABLES THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO AVOID SOME FLAK BY MERELY *IMPLEMENTING* WHAT THE COMMISSION TOLD US TO DO
THUS THE BOARD SAID IT WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO GIVE BANK OF NEW YORK MORE THAN ONE EXTENSION OF THE INITIAL NINETY DAYS TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER

THE BIG DIFFERENCE DISTURBS EUROPEAN OIL MEN
<NOISE> THE QUESTION WAS WHAT FORM THIS CONFLICT WOULD TAKE
THE CIVIL WAR WAS FINALLY FOUGHT OVER MAINTAINING THE UNION
BUT WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN NO UNION
WHAT IF THE SOUTH HAD BEEN A SEPARATE NATION
WOULD SOUTHERNERS BLACK OR WHITE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED FULL EQUALITY IF THEY HAD BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE UNION AS A CONQUERED PROVINCE
OR WHAT IF THE WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED AND SLAVERY JUST DRIFTED ON AND ON
<NOISE> WOULD THE SOUTH HAVE BECOME ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICA
I WOULDN'T BET AGAINST IT

THEY NEED ONLY LISTEN TO THE GROUP OF EIGHT WOMEN GATHERED HERE FOR A DISCUSSION OF WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS IN FASHION RETAILING
MANUFACTURERS WOULD SWIFTLY LEARN THAT THEIR CLOTHES OFTEN AREN'T RIGHT FOR WOMEN WHO WORK WHILE RETAILERS WOULD FIND THAT THEY HAVEN'T SUFFICIENTLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THEIR CUSTOMERS' BUSY LIVES
<NOISE> NEW YORK CITY'S BOARD OF EDUCATION WOULD DISAGREE
MY HIGH SCHOOL'S ADMINISTRATION WOULD TOO

DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER THE FED NUDGED UP SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES TO RESTRAIN THE ECONOMY
BUT WORRIED AS ALWAYS ABOUT BECOMING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL THE FED TRIED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION

THAT IS DEAD WRONG
WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
SUCH COST CUTTING EFFORTS HAVE WORSENED LABOR DISPUTES WHICH HAVE IN TURN PITTED NON UNION PILOTS AGAINST PRO UNION PILOTS
FIRST OFFICER GUY CASEY WAS ONCE A CAPTAIN AT CONTINENTAL BUT LOST HIS SENIORITY DURING THE BITTER STRIKE THERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO ORGANIZE
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT THE EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY

HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
<NOISE> A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
<NOISE> SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN *OPPORTUNITY* TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERNS
ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS

THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCONTINUED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
THE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR

TO STAVE OFF AN ATTACK MR. HARRISON SAYS OUR POSITION WAS THAT WE WERE NEVER IN DEFAULT ON OUR LEASE
WE MAINTAIN THAT THE BANK STOPPED FUNDING
I'M POSITIVE ON THE MOVE TO HIS NEW POST MR. RHINES SAID
I GREW UP IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR GROUP
MR. RHINES HELD A NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN THE COMPANY'S SEMICONDUCTOR OPERATIONS BEFORE TAKING THE DATA SYSTEMS JOB IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
HALLMARK HOWEVER HAS SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE THESE STATIONS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE FORMAT
THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
THESE ARE THE REALITIES OF SOUTH AFRICA SAYS MR. DE BEER
HIS EYEBROWS ARCH ONCE AGAIN
<NOISE> WHAT DO WE DO
ROBERT MCCLEMENTS JUNIOR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID SUN CONTINUES TO SEEK AN ACQUISITION <NOISE> THAT WILL PROVIDE THE RIGHT MIX OF ASSETS
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID SUN IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LARGE IN THE AREA OF ENERGY RESERVES
THE SPOKESMAN SAID SUN HAS MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL THAT IT HAS GAINED FROM SPINOFFS AND DIVESTITURES OF COMPANIES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
<NOISE> NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
DOLE STRATEGISTS BELATEDLY SEEM TO BE RECOGNIZING THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION
THEY MET YESTERDAY IN WASHINGTON TO REVIEW THEIR POSITION
IT SURPRISED PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN JUST HOW INTENSE THE REACTION WAS TO DOLE'S POSITION SAYS ONE OF THE SENATOR'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISERS
WHO GOT HER VOTE LAST SEPTEMBER
GENERAL
BUSSI SHE SAYS
I THINK WE NEED A HARD HAND
FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
NON INTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING
PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
THAT'S A BUSINESS DECISION THAT THE MANAGER HAS TO MAKE MR. KEANE SAYS
IT'S GOING TO AFFECT HIS RETURN
<NOISE> AND IN THE LONG RUN THE RETURN WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE MANAGER STAYS IN HIS JOB
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
MR. MURRAY FORTY NINE YEARS OLD HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO ASSUME THE POSTS OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST
HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN JANUARY WHEN FLEET FINANCIAL GROUP MERGED WITH NORSTAR BANCORPORATION
FLEET NORSTAR RETAINS HEADQUARTERS IN PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND AND IN ALBANY
ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS
AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
<NOISE> THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PREMARIN BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORPORATION'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF PREMARIN LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID PREMARIN ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGAN CHECKING ITS OTHER JETS FOR CRACKS
IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
AND SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW AND WAITING
HOURS BEFORE THE ARGUMENTS BEGIN LAWYERS AND AIDES REPRESENTING OUTSIDE INVESTORS WILL BEGIN CIRCLING
THEY WILL STAKE OUT CHOICE SEATS NEAR THE EXIT AND PLOT ESCAPE ROUTES TO NEARBY TELEPHONES
ONCE THE HEARING BEGINS THEY WILL HANG ON THE JUDGE'S EVERY WORD
A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
JUAN CALDERA A SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD AGRICULTURAL WORKER FROM CIUDAD JUAREZ CHIHUAHUA IS OUTSIDE FREDDY'S AT ONE A. M. LOOKING FOR HIS EMPLOYER
<NOISE> FOR HIS AMNESTY APPLICATION MR. CALDERA NEEDS THE BOSS'S SIGNATURE TO HELP PROVE THAT HE HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR AT LEAST NINETY DAYS
ACTUALLY MR. CALDERA HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS
AMONG THE BIG BASHES THAT DIDN'T SURVIVE WAS FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION'S YEAR END EXTRAVAGANZA WHICH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ENTERTAINED THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
RATHER THAN FUND AN ENCORE THE BROKERAGE FIRM CONTRIBUTED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES NEEDIEST CASES FUND AND THE COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS IN NEW YORK
SIMILARLY AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY THE DINING ROOM STAFF DID WITHOUT ITS ANNUAL PARTY AND INSTEAD GAVE A LUNCH FOR A GROUP OF HOMELESS CHILDREN
WHEN REMINDED OF THE ROLE REVERSALS IRVING'S MR. RICE SAYS THE FACT THAT THE MERGER TALK NEVER WENT FURTHER OBVIOUSLY SHOWS THERE IS NO COMMONALITY
A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. BACOT SAYS THIS A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN BANKING AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE INTERVENING YEARS
THE RELEVANCE OF THOSE COMMENTS TO TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES ISN'T VERY GREAT
MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
MEANWHILE SHARE PRICES CLOSED HIGHER IN SYDNEY HONG KONG WELLINGTON SEOUL AND MANILA AND WERE LOWER IN SINGAPORE
TRADING WAS DESCRIBED AS LIGHT TO MODERATE
THE TAIPEI MARKET WAS CLOSED
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS THE THREAT OF RAIN AND FAVORABLE SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS PUSHED SOYBEAN AND CORN FUTURES PRICES LOWER
THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE AND A HALF CENTS
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE EXPLAINS THE PROBLEMS AS THE OPPOSITE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
LAST YEAR YOU HAD TUMULTUOUS SWINGS IN THE MARKETS THEMSELVES HE SAYS
THIS YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE NARROWER SWINGS BUT VOLUME WILL BE LOWER WITH REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
CLASS A. STOCK HAS ONE TWENTIETH OF A VOTE PER SHARE AND WILL RECEIVE AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF TEN CENTS A SHARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY
CLASS B. STOCK HAS ONE VOTE PER SHARE BUT PRESIDIO HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THOSE SHARES
<NOISE> PRESIDIO HOLDERS MAY EXCHANGE THEIR CLASS B. SHARES ON A SHARE FOR SHARE BASIS THROUGH JANUARY THIRTIETH
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
JUDGE THEM ON THEIR PERSONALITY JUDGE THEM ON ANYTHING YOU WANT THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES TELLS THE CROWD
<NOISE> THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHEERER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING REGULATORS WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
WITH THE INITIAL FINANCING COMPLETE L. S. I. LOOKED ABROAD IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR ITS NEXT INFUSION
<NOISE> WE DECIDED TO GO TO INVESTORS WHO'D PAY A HIGHER PRICE EXPLAINS MR. CORRIGAN
AT THE TIME EUROPEANS WERE CLAMORING TO INVEST IN U. S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN GOOD DEALS HE SAYS
IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
TORONTO BASED P. C. L. MAKES PACKAGING AND FURNITURE
ROBERT J. TWEEDY ITS PRESIDENT SAID THE COMPANY IS LOOKING AT ITS OPTIONS BUT HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER
MR. TWEEDY AND THOMAS N. DAVIDSON CHAIRMAN OWN NINETEEN PERCENT OF P. C. L.'S FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS <NOISE> WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
<NOISE> BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
<NOISE> STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
<NOISE> TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS

THE SURVEY'S COMPOSITE INDEX FELL FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT IN NOVEMBER FROM OCTOBER'S SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT
A FIGURE ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS GENERALLY EXPANDING
<NOISE> NOVEMBER MARKS THE SIXTEENTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF EXPANSION
TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEEN LOW
LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH S:TAGFLATION

<NOISE> I WANTED TO SPECULATE HE EXPLAINS
WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREED ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS

KIDDER PEABODY WAS FINED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BY THE S. E. C. TO SETTLE INSIDER TRADING AND OTHER CHARGES
THE PENALTY IS SECOND ONLY TO IVAN BOESKY'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FINE LAST FALL <NOISE>

FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING A- PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
THE DOLLAR'S SLIPPAGE CAME DESPITE MORE COMMENTS FROM TREASURY SECRETARY JAMES BAKER AIMED AT SUPPORTING IT
IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW MR. BAKER SAID THE U. S. AND ITS TOP SIX ECONOMIC ALLIES ARE PREPARED TO ACT TO STABILIZE THE DOLLAR AROUND CURRENT LEVELS
LAST WEEK THE TREASURY SECRETARY WARNED IN A SPEECH THAT A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE U. S. CURRENCY'S VALUE WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES <NOISE> LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW CONTRACT THE PALMDALE FACILITY WILL REOPEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WITH EMPLOYMENT PEAKING AT THOUSAND IN ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
ANOTHER THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WILL BE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE AT ROCKWELL'S DOWNEY CALIFORNIA FACILITY
ONLY FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS IN TOTAL WILL BE CREATED
EDWARD KENNEDY A ROCKWELL SPOKESMAN SAID MANY OF THOSE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE IN PALMDALE WILL BE THOSE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING B. ONE B. AIRCRAFT
A DIGITAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE COURT ACTION DOESN'T CHANGE THE STATUS QUO
THE PART OF THE RULING THAT WAS OVERTURNED HASN'T BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE LAST JANUARY <NOISE> WHEN EMULEX OBTAINED THE STAY HE SAID
HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
MR. PRENDERGAST ALSO ADMIRES NOMURA'S PERSEVERANCE
<NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN CALLING ON US FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AND DIDN'T GENERATE ANY BUSINESS FOR THE FIRST TEN HE SAYS
THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THE WEALTH OF JAPAN AND THE FLOWS OF CAPITAL FROM JAPAN HAVE PAID OFF FOR THEM
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D SIT BACK AND JUST ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS <NOISE> SAID EDWARD P. NICOSKI MARKET STRATEGIST AT PIPER JAFFRAY AND HOPWOOD INC. MINNEAPOLIS
BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME STRONG BUYING HERE
WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS BREAKING OUT OF THEIR TRADING RANGES
<NOISE> THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN *ILLINOIS* THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
-I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
CHAMPION SAID ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED WORKERS STRUCK ITS FIVE LUMBER AND PLYWOOD PLANTS IN THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND
STAMFORD CONN. BASED CHAMPION HAS FOURTEEN SUCH PLANTS NATIONWIDE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
THE INTERNATIONAL WOODWORKERS OF AMERICA AND THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS UNION STRUCK TWO CHAMPION MILLS WHERE THE CONTRACT RECENTLY EXPIRED ACCORDING TO A CHAMPION SPOKESMAN
PICKET LINES ERECTED BY THOSE STRIKERS QUICKLY CLOSED THE OTHERS WHERE CONTRACTS EITHER HAVE EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE BY JULY THIRTY FIRST HE ADDED
<NOISE> TOBACCO HEIRESS DORIS DUKE AGREED TO POST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NEEDED BY IMELDA MARCOS TO SECURE BAIL ON RACKETEERING CHARGES

THE JURY ALSO FOUND THAT CLAYTON UNDER MISSOURI COMMON LAW HAD BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES BECAUSE OF SELF DEALING
THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE AGREES ARTHUR CHRISTY THE FIRST SPECIAL PROSECUTOR APPOINTED UNDER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LAW
IN PAST INVESTIGATION HE NOTES THE FOCUS HAS BEEN QUITE NARROW
BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
THE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
SOME TIRE EXECUTIVES SUCH AS JOHN J. NEVIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FIRESTONE TIRE AND I- RUBBER COMPANY SAY MR. STONE UNDERSTANDS THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS
BUT MR. STONE'S UNION CRITICS AREN'T SO GENEROUS
THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN LAX ABOUT ORGANIZING NEW MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE
UNDER THE AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL YPSILANTI SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE ONE POINT NINE THREE FIVE SHARES OF TRUSTCORP COMMON FOR EACH COMMON SHARE OF YPSILANTI
TRUSTCORP SAID IT PLANS TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
YPSILANTI SAVINGS BANK HAS ABOUT ONE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS
TRUSTCORP INCOME IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH ASSETS OF F- FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS
CRITICS OF INDEXING CHARGE THAT THE APPROACH LACKS IMAGINATION AND AMOUNTS TO SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY
ADVOCATES REPLY THAT INDEXING MEANS LOWER MANAGEMENT FEES THAN THOSE OF ACTIVELY MANAGED BOND FUNDS
<NOISE> ALSO INDEXING IN RECENT YEARS OFTEN HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RESULTS <NOISE> THAN MANY ACTIVE MANAGERS
BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
<NOISE> HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
WHEN STOCKS ARE RISING PORTFOLIO INSURERS DON'T HEDGE AND INSTEAD RIDE THE MARKET HIGHER
WHEN STOCKS ARE FALLING PORTFOLIO INSURERS SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES IN EFFECT CUSHIONING THE VALUES OF THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS FROM THE FULL BRUNT OF A DROPPING MARKET
THE IDEA ACCORDING TO WALL STREET PROPONENTS IS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AT A LOW COST
AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
DECEMBER DELIVERY GOLD SETTLED AT FOUR EIGHTY TWO POINT SEVEN ZERO DOLLARS FOR A DECLINE OF TWELVE POINT EIGHT ZERO DOLLARS
DECEMBER SILVER FELL THIRTY THREE POINT THREE CENTS TO SIX POINT SIX FOUR FIVE DOLLARS
JANUARY PLATINUM WAS DOWN THIRTEEN POINT SIX ZERO DOLLARS TO FOUR NINE ZERO POINT FOUR ZERO DOLLARS
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
CAR SALES APPARENTLY HAVE LEVELED OFF AFTER DISAPPOINTING RESULTS EARLY IN THE YEAR FOLLOWED BY A SHARP UPTICK IN LATE JANUARY
BIGGER INCENTIVES FUELED THE REBOUND AND HAVE HELPED SUSTAIN THE SALES PACE
CHRYSLER CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE BOOSTED CASH REBATES TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON SOME MODELS
<NOISE> GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
GENERALLY THERE'S NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCH OF THEIR FUNDS EMPLOYEES CAN BORROW IF THEIR ACCOUNTS TOTAL TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS
FOR LARGER ACCOUNTS EMPLOYEES ARE RESTRICTED TO BORROWING HALF THE TOTAL BUT NO MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
LOANS MUST BE REPAID WITHIN FIVE YEARS UNLESS THE MONEY GOES TOWARD BUYING A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IN WHICH CASE LONGER REPAYMENT TERMS CAN BE ARRANGED
BORROWED FUNDS AREN'T TAXED
BUT A WITHDRAWAL IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME AND IS SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT PENALTY TAX
LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL
A *SUBPOENA* IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING
MR. ICAHN'S LAWYERS AT WEIL GOTSCHAL AND MANGES IN NEW YORK SAID THE INVESTIGATION HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF MR. ICAHN'S BID
BUT MR. GIBBS IS HOPEFUL THAT MANY TAXPAYERS WILL ACCEPT
AMONG OTHER INCENTIVES THE NEW TAX LAW PHASES OUT THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE I. R. S.
<NOISE> THE I. R. S. HA- ALSO HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAX COURT CHALLENGES TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN TAX SHELTERS
WE'RE WINNING MORE THAN WE'RE LOSING THE I. R. S. CHIEF POINTS OUT
DOUBLEDAY ALSO PROVIDED BERTELSMANN WITH MUCH NEEDED U. S. BOOK MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS <NOISE>
MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER CLAIM THAT IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS NOT THE DOGS THEMSELVES ARE TO BLAME FOR THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATTACKS
THEY'RE AMORAL SAYS AN OFFICIAL OF THE UNITED KENNEL CLUB A PRESTIGIOUS PEDIGREE ASSOCIATION
THEY'LL DO WHAT THE TRAINER ALLOWS THEM TO DO
K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS
THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
<NOISE> LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID
THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE
CURRENT HEMDALE HOLDERS THEN WOULD HAVE OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COMPUTER MEMORIES' SHARES
THE SURVIVING COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED HEMDALE FILM CORPORATION AND JOHN DALY HEMDALE'S CURRENT CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY
A SPOKESMAN F:OR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM <NOISE> AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS THE COMPANY THAT INVENTED THE OVERNIGHT EXPRESS BUSINESS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO STILL DOMINATES IT
FEDERAL EXPRESS COLLECTS MORE THAN HALF THE REVENUE IN WHAT IS NOW MORE THAN A SIX BILLION INDUSTRY
AND AT A TIME WHEN DETERIORATING SERVICE IS A NATIONAL MALADY THIS COMPANY CLAIMS TO DELIVER MORE THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ITS LETTERS AND PACKAGES ON TIME
HOUSING STARTS TOTALED ONE <NOISE> SIX SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UNITS LAST YEAR BY TWENTY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN DECEMBER ALONE STARTS ROSE TWENTY POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO ONE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE EIGHTY NINE UNITS
THAT MARKED THE TWENTIETH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASE
EARLY FEBRUARY NORTH AMERICAN BUILT CAR SALES EDGED UP ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ACCORDING TO FIGURES REPORTED LAST WEEK
THAT TRANSLATES INTO A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATE OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION VEHICLES COMPARED WITH A SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION RATE A YEAR EARLIER
THIS WEEK'S MID FEBRUARY REPORT ON CAR SALES WILL TELL WHETHER THAT PACE WAS BEING MAINTAINED
OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY <NOISE> REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER
AS PORTFOLIO STRATEGISTS PUZZLE OVER THE MARKET IMPACT OF THIS WAVE OF GOOD NEWS THEY COME UP WITH SOME SHARPLY DIVERGENT OPINIONS
AFTER LAR(RY)- LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN
BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND

OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
<NOISE> CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES

ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN INTERNATIONAL STOCK PICKERS JOHN TEMPLETON NEARLY EQUALED THE INDEX WITHOUT ANY JAPANESE STOCKS IN HIS SMALL TEMPLETON FOREIGN FUND
HE DID SO VIA WINNING BETS IN SUCH MARKETS AS MEXICO CANADA AND BRITAIN
WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE HE SAID
HIS LARGER FUNDS WHICH CAN INCLUDE U. S. STOCKS DIDN'T FARE AS WELL
TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE

CONDOM SALES FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS ENDED IN APRIL
CARTER WALLACE'S SHARE AMOUNTS TO OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET

IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT <NOISE> AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
IN RECENT MONTHS SPICER HAS CUT ITS ONE THOUSAND MEMBER U. S. STAFF BY TEN PERCENT IN AN EFFORT TO CUT COSTS
MR. BERNSTEIN SAID THAT A MERGER OF THE TWO FIRMS WORLD WIDE WOULD CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION <NOISE> WITH ONE BILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE

<NOISE> MS. BASS WON'T DISCUSS STRATEGY FOR I. MAGNIN
BUT INDUSTRY OBSERVERS SAY I. MAGNIN LIKE OTHER S- RETAILERS IN TODAY'S SATURATED MARKETS <NOISE> WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A MORE FOCUSED IDENTITY
MS. BASS ALSO WILL HAVE TO REASSESS THE VALUE OF SOME OF ITS SCATTERED STORES INCLUDING THOSE IN CHICAGO WASHINGTON AND ARIZONA AND INCREASE SALES VOLUME
THAT'S THE ONLY CURE SAYS MARK SHULMAN PRESIDENT OF LIMITED INCORPORATED HENRI BENDEL AND A FORMER EXECUTIVE AT I. MAGNIN AND BLOOMINGDALE'S

STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
MR. JOYNES WILL OVERSEE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING UNITS AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES THE COMPANY SAID
THE SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T COMMENT AS TO WHETHER MR. JOYNES <NOISE> MIGHT SUCCEED MR. DAY AS CHAIRMAN
MR. DAY MUST RETIRE AT AGE SIXTY FIVE
UNDER THE FEDERAL RAILWAY LABOR ACT THE REJECTION TRIGGERED A THIRTY DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT STARTED YESTERDAY
IF AMERICAN AND ITS UNION CAN'T REACH A SETTLEMENT BY THEN THE AIRLINE CAN IMPOSE ITS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER OR LOCK OUT ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS WOULD ALSO BE FREE TO STRIKE <NOISE> BUT IT HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO DO SO
THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES <NOISE> ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER PHIL DILEO MR. KELLNER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST MONEYMAKERS
KELLNER DILEO STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH ONLY FIVE MILLION AND REPORTEDLY HAS HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL GAIN OF SIXTY PERCENT BEFORE PAYOUTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS
LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION
A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES <NOISE> WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN ONE QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE

WALL STREET ANALYSTS LOOK TO THE INTEREST IN HOUSTON BASED ENRON CORP.`S OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS AS A GAUGE OF LIKELY INTEREST IN TENNECO'S PROPERTIES
IN LATE APRIL ENRON AN INTEGRATED NATURAL GAS CONCERN PUT OIL AND GAS ASSETS UP FOR SALE
ANALYSTS VALUED THOSE PROPERTIES AT TWO BILLION AND ONE SAID ENRON HAS RECEIVED ABOUT TWENTY OFFERS
ENRON WOULDN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF OFFERS
MANY PEOPLE CRITICIZE ADS THAT GLORIFY JUNK
SOME SINGLED OUT AS A CONTRADICTORY A COOKING OIL AD TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO CUT DOWN ON CHOLESTEROL BUT FEATURING FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES
IT'S ALSO DISHONEST SOME SAID TO OMIT INFORMATION OR HIDE IT IN SMALL PRINT
THEY NOTED THAT ADS FOR HIGH FIBER CEREALS NEGLECT TO MENTION THEIR SALT AND SUGAR CONTENT
I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID
BIDS WERE DOWN A QUARTER TO A HALF A POINT AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK
IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK
HE ALSO WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO NINETY MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS OR NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS IN NINETY DAYS
HE DID SO WITH ENTHUSIASM HE DROPPED DRUG USING FRIENDS AND IT SEEMED OUR TROUBLES SOON WOULD BE BEHIND US
BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR *SEXUAL* PARTNERS
LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY OUT THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON
BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS
IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT ONE EIGHT TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE OH FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE

SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT CHUN HAS CHOSEN ROH TAE WOO HEAD OF THE RULING PARTY TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR WHEN CHUN'S TERM ENDS IN FEBRUARY

HIS ELECTION IS ALMOST GUARANTEED
SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF THE BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH <NOISE> A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH A DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT
BUT ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PREFER SUCH A PLAN BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN CURTAILING THE COMPANY'S AMBITIOUS STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM
IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT A SMALL GROUP OF INVESTORS ACQUIRES A COMPANY IN A TRANSACTION FINANCED LARGELY WITH BORROWING
ULTIMATELY THE DEBT IS PAID WITH FUNDS GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S OPERATIONS <NOISE> OR THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS
PEOPLE HE POINTS OUT COME TO HIM NOW
THEY KNOW JESSE CAN DELIVER
THE BOTTOM LINE IS BECOMING IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR CHILDREN GET JESSE
IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO STAND UP WITH YOU AT THE FARM AUCTION OR STAND WITH YOU AT A CLOSED FACTORY GATE GET JESSE
IT'S A REPUTATION WITH A GROWING CREDIBILITY TO IT
A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
PRICES ON UPSCALE ACURA DIVISION'S BASE MODEL CARS JUMPED EVEN HIGHER THAN HONDA DIVISION'S PRICES
THE ACURA INTEGRA JUMPED THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT OR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS TO TEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

MR. PERONI AGREED THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY IS A POSITIVE FACTOR FOR STOCK PRICES
THE BETTER BEHAVIOR OF THE DOLLAR IS A BIG INCENTIVE FOR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS TO STICK BOTH FEET IN THE WATER HE SAID
HE PREDICTED THAT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS COULD BE AS HIGH AS THE UPPER TWENTY TWO HUNDREDS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER
HOWEVER JOHN MENDELSON CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT DEAN WITTER'S REYNOLDS BELIEVES SUCH A *SLUMP* COULD HAPPEN
I THINK YOU WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL TURNOVER LEVELS IN A BEAR MARKET
<NOISE> YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO SEE A REAL DULL LOUSY MARKET
TURNOVER LEVEL THAT YEAR SIXTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT
THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THIS AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SPECIALTY RETAILING TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON SEARS'S BOTTOM LINE
SEARS'S MERCHANDISE GROUP ALONE GENERATED PROFITS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT
HOWEVER A SEARS SPOKESMAN SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE ANY QUALIFICATIONS ABOUT HOW QUICKLY OR HOW MUCH SPECIALTY ACQUISITIONS WOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO EARNINGS
DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES INC. IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR EIGHT PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT NINETY NINE AND ONE QUARTER
SEPARATELY ITS DILLARD INVESTMENT COMPANY UNIT IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF *TWELVE* YEAR SEVEN AND THREE EIGHTHS PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT PAR
BOTH NOTE ISSUES WILL PAY ACCRUED INTEREST FROM LAST THURSDAY
BOTH OFFERINGS ARE BEING UNDERWRITTEN BY GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY AND AREN'T REDEEMABLE BEFORE MATURITY
THE LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS BASED RETAILER SAID IT WILL USE THE PROCEEDS TO RETIRE DEBT TO FINANCE OPERATIONS AND FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES
THE INVESTMENT UNIT SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO BUY CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE GROWING OUT OF THE PARENT'S RETAIL SALES
PROCEEDS MAY ALSO BE USED TO RETIRE SHORT TERM BORROWINGS THE UNIT SAID

LAST SEPTEMBER H. B. O. REJECTED A THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION OFFER FROM ANDOVER GROUP
IN MARCH ANDOVER SAID IT WOULD SEEK TO ELECT ITS OWN SLATE OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL MEETING THEN SCHEDULED FOR APRIL THIRTIETH
CITING THE CREATION OF A SPECIAL DIRECTORS COMMITTEE TO STUDY FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES H. B. O. ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH POSTPONED THE ANNUAL MEETING
THE COMPANY DIDN'T ANNOUNCE THE VOTES OF THE APRIL THIRTIETH PROXY VOTE
NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY RESTRUCTURING CANDIDATE
ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS
BUT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVING BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ASSET VALUES HAVE CHANGED THAT
<NOISE> T. P. A. REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENT DEATHS BY FIFTY ONE PERCENT IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER HEART ATTACK
OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS WHO WERE GIVEN T. P. A. TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DIED IN THAT PERIOD
OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
THESE DAYS REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL SAYS CONGRESSIONAL POWER IS MUCH MORE DIFFUSE
NO SINGLE MEMBER NOT EVEN A VETERAN CHAIRMAN LIKE HIMSELF CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY OF THE BARONS OF OLD
THE ORDINARY MEMBERS HAVE ACHIEVED MUCH MORE POWER THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTION HE SAYS
TODAY THE CHAIRMEN ARE NET LOSERS
THE TIGERS DON'T LIKE TO STRESS THE SOURCE OF THEIR BASEBALL *PROWESS*
THE TEAM'S PRESS RELEASES SAY THE TEAM HAS ENGLISH BORN AND BRED PLAYERS
UNDER QUESTIONING IN THE STADIUM PUB MR. HUNT ADMITS TO HAVING RECRUITED A DUTCHMAN A PAKISTANI AND AN AMERICAN THIRD BASEMAN

FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE
ANNUAL GROWTH OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT AND GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
MR. BUCHI BELIEVES SUCH GROWTH CAN BE SUSTAINED
SOUTH AFRICA ANGOLA AND CUBA ENDED A ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT OR A DATE TO MEET AGAIN
BUT SOURCES SAID THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH INVOLVE *NAMIBIAN* INDEPENDENCE AND PEACE OF ANGOLA HAVE MADE PROGRESS
APPARENTLY THE THREE NATIONS ARE FOCUSING ON A U. S. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD GET CUBAN TROOPS OUT OF ANGOLA IN TWO YEARS
<NOISE> STOCK EXCHANGES COMMODITY MARKETS MANY BANKS AND SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE U. S. MONDAY IN OBSERVANCE OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
<NOISE> FEDERAL OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY REGULAR MAIL DELIVERIES <NOISE>
MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ALSO WILL BE CLOSED
<NOISE> TO HELP BOOST SALES FORD HAS SENT OUT LETTERS TO DEALERS TOUTING THE AIR BAG
ITS SAFETY DIRECTOR ALSO SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS VISITING DEALERS AND PROMOTING THE DEVICE
THE FORD SPOKESMAN SAID THIS LATEST INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE CUSTOMERS' PERCEIVED VALUE OF THE AIR BAGS
U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
<NOISE> THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EITHER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
THOUGH THERE ISN'T A CURE FOR AIDS PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE CAN BE OFFERED TREATMENTS TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES
<NOISE> FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN TAKE MEDICATION TO PREVENT CATCHING THE KIND OF PNEUMONIA THAT MOST COMMONLY LEADS TO THE DEATH OF AIDS SUFFERERS
AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED AIDS CAN TAKE STEPS TO GUARD AGAINST OTHER DISEASES SUCH AS HERPES AND HEPATITIS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO ACCELERATE ITS ONSET
<NOISE> BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISKS PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING
NO LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS CAN MAKE A NUCLEAR FACILITY SAFE UNLESS IT HAS GOOD MANAGEMENT THE N. R. C. TOLD CONGRESS LAST YEAR
<NOISE> INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS
<NOISE> IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF THE PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS
<NOISE> IN ADDITION TO A LARGE FUEL LOAD FOR THE FLIGHT TO PHOENIX ARIZONA THE FLIGHT WAS JAMMED WITH PASSENGERS
THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE PEOPLE ON A PLANE WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE PASSENGER SEATS
THE EXTRAS INCLUDED SIX CREW MEMBERS TWO BABIES WHO WERE BEING HELD BY PASSENGERS AND TWO NORTHWEST EMPLOYEES RIDING ON TWO OF THE PLANE'S JUMP SEATS
WIRE SERVICE REPORTS SAID TWO PERSONS ON THE GROUND ALSO WERE KILLED AND THAT A FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL WAS HOSPITALIZED IN CRITICAL CONDITION
LATE LAST NIGHT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED THAT THE GIRL WAS IDENTIFIED BY HER GRANDFATHER
HER FATHER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE PASSENGERS ON THE NORTHWEST AIRLINER AND DIED IN THE CRASH
D. D. C. CAUSES A PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY TINGLING NUMBING AND PAIN PRINCIPALLY IN THE FEET THAT CAN REQUIRE POTENT PAINKILLERS SUCH AS MORPHINE
IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER SUCH SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE REVERSED DOCTOR SOO SAID
<NOISE> WHILE AIDS ALSO CAUSES SOME NEUROPATHY INCLUDING BOTH DISCOMFORT AND WEAKNESS IN THE HANDS AND FEET THE DRUG'S WORST SIDE EFFECT IS THE FOOT PAIN
DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
I COME WITH NO BAGGAGE WITH NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT THE BEST REGULATORY METHOD OR THE BEST WAY THE MARKET SHOULD OPERATE
I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
<NOISE> FOR THE NINE MONTHS NET INCREASED TO ABOUT SIX MILLION OR FIFTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM THREE POINT FIVE MILLION A YEAR EARLIER
NINE MONTH NET A YEAR AGO INCLUDED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF SPECIAL ITEMS
SALES NEARLY DOUBLED TO A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION FROM NINETY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION
<NOISE> ALL SEVEN REGIONAL BELLS HAVE VOWED TO APPEAL THE DECEMBER THIRD RULING BY JUDGE HAROLD GREENE THAT FORBIDS THEM TO DESIGN FABRICATE OR ASSEMBLE TELECOMMUNICATION PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT
<NOISE> OF COURSE IF THE APPEAL FAILS MANY VENTURES COULD BE JEOPARDIZED OR SCRATCHED
BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
<NOISE> NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
<NOISE> ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
WHILE CAMPBELL IS CONFIDENT ITS MICROWAVE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LURE NEW CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAMPLED A FROZEN BREAKFAST OTHER COMPETITORS ARE WAFFLING
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM MICROWAVE WAFFLES SAID A SPOKESMAN AT I. C. INDUSTRIES
BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT THE TOASTER WAFFLES THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IN THIRTY SECONDS ARE MORE CONVENIENT AND BETTER QUALITY
A LORIMAR SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT MR. ADELSON AGREED TO BUY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND SHARES OF LORIMAR STOCK FROM MR. GARIN
<NOISE> THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN MESSRS.
ADELSON AND GARIN WERE ARRANGED BEFORE DISCUSSIONS RESUMED WITH WARNER
THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
<NOISE> THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS
STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THOSE THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
<NOISE> AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WANT TO USE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GIVE LABOR THINGS IT NOW HAS DIFFICULTY WINNING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE
CONGRESS GETS CREDIT FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYERS FOOT THE BILL
<NOISE> J. P.
MORGAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HERO OF MINE MR. FARKAS SAYS
OF COURSE HE QUICKLY ADDS I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A ROBBER BARON IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM
THE SENATE APPROVED A NINE POINT FOUR BILLION SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WAS AMENDED TO REQUIRE IMMIGRANTS TO UNDERGO AIDS TESTING
IT WAS PASSED SEVENTY ONE TO TWENTY THREE
THE AMENDMENT WAS THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR MANDATORY SCREENING FOR THE DISEASE
THE ORANGE BOWL BUILT IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE IS FALLING APART
AT ONE GAME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE CONCRETE CHIPS FROM THE UPPER DECK RAINED ON THE CROWD
BUT MIAMI VOTERS THREE TIMES REJECTED BOND ISSUES FOR REPAIRS AND OFFICIALS STRUNG MR. ROBBIE ALONG FOR YEARS WITHOUT MAKING ANY IMPROVEMENTS CITING THE EXPENSE
WHEN HE THREATENED TO BUILD HIS OWN STADIUM HE RECALLS THE OFFICIALS ROLLED THEIR EYES AND SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE
NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
NON INTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING
IAN CAMPBELL AN ATLANTA SECOND GRADER DID JUST THAT LAST MONTH TAKING TOP HONORS IN THE CATEGORY FOR THE BEST NEW DESIGN
HIS APPROACH JUST MAKE SOMETHING UP
IF IT FLIES IT WORKS
MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
MOTIVES ARE MIXED
SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
<NOISE> IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT
THE GANGS ARE EVEN BECOMING ADEPT AT THEIR OWN SORT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS
THEY BUY FOOD FOR THE ELDERLY AND SNEAKERS FOR KIDS MAKING WARY ALLIES OF BOTH
THEY SPONSOR PICNICS WHERE THEY PUT UP HUGE BANNERS FLAUNTING THEIR NAMES AND COLORS
MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
WE'D LOVE TO BUY THOSE HATS IN AMERICA MR. KOSYAKOV SAYS
HE WOULD ALSO LOVE TO GET CLEARANCE TO BUY AND CARRY GUNS
IT'S A NECESSITY
WE ARE NEGOTIATING THAT
WE CAN HAVE AIR PISTOLS NOW
YOU HAVE THEM ON SALE IN AMERICA
HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN

M. I. FIVE NOTED THAT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A FIRM OF TIMBER MERCHANTS LORD WILSON HAD MADE NINETEEN VISITS TO THE SOVIET UNION
<NOISE> A FORMER M. I. FIVE OFFICER JAMES MILLER TOLD THE SUNDAY TIMES THAT HIS CASE OFFICER HAD ASSURED HIM THAT LORD WILSON WAS A SOVIET AGENT
A GROUP OF M. I. FIVE ZEALOTS UNDERTOOK APPARENTLY ON THEIR OWN TO DRIVE HIM FROM OFFICE
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
A LIMITED STRIKE TARGETED AT KEY PLANTS A STRATEGY FOR THE U. A. W. USED A WEEK AGAINST G. M. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BUFFER THE IMPACT
A STRIKE AGAINST A SECOND COMPANY IN CANADA WHERE THE CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS UNION IS BARGAINING INDEPENDENTLY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME COULD BROADEN THE DAMAGE
THE C. A. W. HAS INDICATED IT WILL TARGET A DIFFERENT AUTO MAKER THAN THE U. A. W. AND IT HAS A WIDER SELECTION
CHRYSLER CORPORATION IS NEGOTIATING IN CANADA THIS YEAR ALTHOUGH ITS U. S. CONTRACT DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
BUT THE EXPERIENCE SHOWED THERE WAS A MUCH BIGGER VIEWER AUDIENCE AND MARKET THAN HOME SHOPPING HAD REALIZED
BOTH M. C. I. AND HOME SHOPPING QUICKLY ADDED CAPACITY
BEFORE THE DELUGE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALLS WAS CONSIDERED A HEAVY DAY
NOW AS MANY AS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CALLS ARE HANDLED A DAY MR. TROUPE SAYS
ONE DAY THOSE WORDS HAUNTED THIS LAND OF IMMENSE SUFFERING
ONE DAY SAY THE PEASANT FARMERS THE FOURTEEN YEAR BUSH WAR AGAINST ANTI GOVERNMENT REBELS WILL BE OVER
ONE DAY DROUGHT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM OUR LAND
ONE DAY THE ECONOMY WILL RECOVER
ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO FEED OURSELVES
THE THIRD WORLD DEBT PROBLEM MOREOVER WAS RELATIVELY STABLE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
THE HIGH INTEREST RATES PRODUCED BY MR. VOLCKER'S TIGHT MONEY IN FACT HELPED START THE PROBLEM ON ITS WAY TO A CRISIS
THE DEBT SITUATION AND WHAT HIGH INTEREST RATES AND A U. S. RECESSION MIGHT DO TO IT HAS TO BE MUCH IN MR. GREENSPAN'S MIND
MR. HEFTER OF JEFFERIES SAYS INVESTORS ARE BASICALLY PICKING SOME STOCKS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SITUATIONS GOING THAT THEY HAVE A DEFINITE IDEA ABOUT
BUT IN GENERAL THE WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE IS STILL VERY PREVALENT OUT THERE
THERE IS NO REAL PRESSURE TO JUMP INTO THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
<NOISE> THE POTENTIAL REWARD IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK AN A. M. GENERAL SPOKESMAN SAID
IF YOU DID A CASH FLOW CHART IT LOOKED AWFUL UNTIL WA:Y OUT IN THE FUTURE
UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL
THEN THERE IS THE DECEMBER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
THE FAVORITE CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ NATIONALIZED THE COUNTRY'S MINERAL RESOURCES WHEN LAST IN OFFICE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE

AMSTRAD IS THE LARGEST EUROPEAN SUPPLIER OF HOME COMPUTERS AND A MAJOR VENDOR OF BUSINESS PERSONAL COMPUTERS
IT JOINS MANY PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS WORLD WIDE REPORTING DIFFICULTIES FROM CHIP SHORTAGES

EDUCATION IS THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH STUDYING A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS TO GAIN INFORMATION AND THE DEXTERITY TO USE YOUR WITS AND YOUR EXPRESSION
EDUCATION PREPARES YOU TO BE SOMEONE MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING
<NOISE> EDUCATION IS WHAT PREPARES YOU TO HEAR MORE WHEN YOU LISTEN TO REACH DEEPER WHEN YOU THINK TO SAY MORE WHEN YOU SPEAK
THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS JUSTIFIED MAINTAINED ROBERT BURGER CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER GIVEN THE GROWING DIFFICULTY IN LAUNCHING MODELS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FIELD
IN ESTABLISHING PRODUCTS WITH CONSUMERS HE SAID IT'S EASIER TO FOCUS AD DOLLARS AND MARKETING EFFORTS IF THERE'S ONLY ONE NAME TO PROMOTE
CHEVROLET IS USING THE SAME APPROACH WITH ITS GEO LINE OF IMPORT CARS THAT DEBUTS THIS FALL
THE RICHMOND VIRGINIA MEDIA CONCERN SAID SALES AND PROFIT FROM ITS NEWSPRINT OPERATIONS WERE AHEAD OF YEAR EARLIER LEVELS
ITS CABLE SYSTEM CONTINUED TO GAIN SUBSCRIBERS NOW TOTALING MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND
REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER IS EXCEEDING FORECASTS MEDIA GENERAL SAID ADDING THAT IT PLANS TO INCREASE RATES AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT PERCENT BEGINNING IN JANUARY
THE AGREEMENT'S IMPACT IN THE U. S. MAY BE QUITE LIMITED
MANY U. S. FOOD COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE REMOVED TROPICAL OILS FROM THEIR PRODUCTS UNDER PRESSURE FROM CONSUMERS AND HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS
THEY AREN'T LIKELY TO PUT THE OILS BACK IN AND RISK LOSING SALES
CHARLES ALLMON EDITOR AND PUBLISHER OF GROWTH STOCK OUTLOOK IS ANOTHER BEAR WHO DOESN'T HEDGE HIS BEARISHNESS
THIS MARKET IS DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY HE CONTENDS
IT'S A SPECULATORS' MARKET NOT AN INVESTORS' MARKET AND SOONER OR LATER IT'S GOING TO COME TO AN IGNOMINIOUS END
MR. ALLMON WONDERS AT THE WIDESPREAD OPTIMISM IN THE FACE OF HIGHER OIL PRICES AND A BURGEONING MONEY SUPPLY WHICH HE SEES AS CERTAIN PRECURSORS OF INFLATION

THEY HOPE IT WILL PUT COUNTERFEITERS OUT OF BUSINESS
JUST HOW FAR AIRBUS WANTS TO TAKE COLLABORATION TALKS REMAINS UNCLEAR
THE U. S. FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS HAS BEEN CALLING FOR AN END TO AIRBUS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND IS THREATENING A TRADE WAR OVER THE ISSUE

THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
THIS IS THE FIRST TEST FOR MR. RUDER'S ABILITY TO ADJUDICATE BETWEEN THE AGENCY'S PROSECUTORS AND ECONOMISTS WHICH CAN BE A FULL TIME JOB
AS USUAL IN THE RECENT PAST THE ECONOMISTS HAVE THE BETTER ARGUMENT HERE
THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO OUTLAW THE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF SHARES IN ANY CASE AND ESPECIALLY NOT WHERE NONPROFESSIONAL SHAREHOLDERS ARE THE BIG WINNERS
THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH <NOISE>

ANOTHER BAROMETER OF THE ECONOMY'S FUTURE COURSE CALLED THE LONG LEADING COMPOSITE IS COMPILED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CYCLE RESEARCH
THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE HAS SIGNALED RECESSIONS ON THE AVERAGE BY FOURTEEN MONTHS A SOMEWHAT LONGER LEAD TIME THAN FOR THE COMMERCE INDEX
IT IS NO SURPRISE ACCORDINGLY THAT THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE REACHED A PEAK BEFORE THE COMMERCE INDEX IN JULY
SINCE THEN THE COMPOSITE HAS FALLEN WITH LITTLE INTERRUPTION
COMPUTERVISION THE PIONEER IN THE COMPUTERIZED DESIGN MARKET HAS HAD POOR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN RECENT YEARS AS IT REVAMPED ITS AGED PRODUCT LINE
HOWEVER RECENTLY IT HAS REPORTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED EARNINGS
ALTHOUGH IT HAS SLIPPED FROM FIRST TO THIRD IN SIZE IN THE INDUSTRY IT RETAINS A SUBSTANTIAL BASE OF CUSTOMERS
NINETEEN NINETY NINE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A SERVING PRESIDENT
IT IS ALL A PRESIDENT CAN DO TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS TIME FOR REFLECTION IS A LUXURY BEYOND REACH
NOR IS THERE TIME FOR A PRESIDENT TO LEARN MUCH BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE WITH WHICH HE COMES TO OFFICE
THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN WE THINK NOT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
FRENCH PRESIDENT MITTERRAND NAMED A LONGTIME SOCIALIST RIVAL MICHEL ROCARD AS PRIME MINISTER

THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
THE TRASH
PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
UNLIKE MORE ECLECTIC RAIDERS MR. TRUMP HAS SO FAR STUCK TO REAL ESTATE
RESORTS HAS BIG UNDEVELOPED LAND HOLDINGS IN ATLANTIC CITY
ALLEGIS' WESTIN PLAZA HOTEL WHICH HE SEEMS TO WANT COULD BE WORTH TWICE AS MUCH IF MADE INTO CONDOMINIUMS HE SAYS
HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATION AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATION
THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST
SALES OF BUILDING MATERIALS INCREASED ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AFTER A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP
OVERALL SALES OF DURABLE GOODS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO LAST THREE YEARS OR MORE FELL ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER RISING THREE POINT ONE PERCENT IN AUGUST
WALL STREET IN GENERAL HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT G. M. IN RECENT WEEKS BECAUSE OF ITS NEW LABOR CONTRACT
THE THREE YEAR PACT INCLUDES A JOB SECURITY PROGRAM THAT PREVENTS LAYOFFS EXCEPT DURING A SALES DROP PREVENTS PLANT CLOSINGS AND SLOWS ATTRITION
MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE PROVISIONS WILL HAMPER G. M.'S EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE OPERATIONS AND SHED UNCOMPETITIVE PLANTS PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OPERATIONS

KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
THE OTHER EUROPEAN MARKETS ALSO POSTED DECLINES

THE INDICATED TIGHTNESS IN U. S. GASOLINE OUGHT TO PREVENT THE REFINERS' FLAT OUT PRODUCTION FROM LEADING TO A PRODUCT PRICE WAR
<NOISE> THE DECLINE IN CRUDE PRICES EVENTUALLY WILL END HOWEVER
OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE
AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY
BUT MR. RANDOL SUGGESTS THAT A TREND TOWARD PERMANENTLY IMPROVED REFINER MARGINS IS SUSTAINABLE
THROUGH ITS U. S. FINANCE SUBSIDIARY TOYOTA HAS ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE U. S. AND PRIVATELY PLACED MEDIUM TERM NOTES
IT HAS ALSO RAISED MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE EUROMARKETS BUT SO FAR HAS AVOIDED ISSUING STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE PUBLIC U. S. MARKET
THE SAME IS TRUE OF MOST JAPANESE COMPANIES
RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
THE TWO VISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN

STOCK PRICES CLIMBED IN ACTIVE TRADING
VOLUME ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE TOTALED A HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SHARES
ADVANCING ISSUES ON THE BIG BOARD WERE AHEAD OF DECLINERS EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SIX TO SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY

THIS MAN WAS COVERED WITH COAL DUST AND HIS CLOTHING WAS WET SAYS DOCTOR MCDONALD TODAY
HE COULD BE LIKE A WALKING ELECTRODE
THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME I- INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
MR. BOTHA ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE EVENTS LOVE THEM
THE CITIZENS OF THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT A TERRIFIC FEELING THE WEEKEND ENGENDERED IN EVERYONE
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAS SO HAPPY THAT IT IS USING A PHOTO FROM LIBERTY WEEKEND IN ADVERTISEMENTS TO ATTRACT BUSINESS TO THE STATE
THOSE WHO WATCHED THE EVENTS ON TELEVISION MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS LOVE THEM
PEOPLE IN FIFTY ONE FOREIGN COUNTRIES ENJOYED THE EVENTS VIA TELEVISION
THE FRENCH WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE CELEBRATION THEY THANKED THE U. S. IN AN AD IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
<NOISE> IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS
COMMUNIQUES ANNOUNCING COMPLETION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS WERE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NOVEMBER NINTH NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
IT IS SAD BUT TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EXTRAVAGANZAS HAVE COME TO BE CONDUCTED AMID THE SORT OF SECURITY OTHERWISE RESERVED FOR THE TRAVELS OF HEADS OF STATE
THE SWISS HOCKEY COACH WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HIS PLAYERS WERE SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW THEIR PASSES AT THE BLUE LINE WHEN THEY BACK CHECKED
HAVING THE BAR PATTERN ON MY PASS CHECKED ELECTRONICALLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TIMES MADE ME FEEL LIKE A TOOTHPASTE CARTON LEAVING A SUPERMARKET
ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE IN- INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE
FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
<NOISE> WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LENDING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
WITH THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AS ITS PRIME CUSTOMER TRACOR WAS HELPLESS WHEN DEFENSE SPENDING SLOWED
INTERNALLY MR. INMAN SAYS HE DISCOVERED THAT EXPENSES COULDN'T BE CUT AS EASILY AS BANKERS HAD FORECAST

ANDREW SHERWOOD A NEW YORK MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT SAYS THAT ONLY ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES DO THEIR OWN FIRING
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPULSIVE BUILDERS HE SAYS
THEY LIKE ACQUIRING COMPANIES MAKING PROFITS GO UP AND RECRUITING PEOPLE
FIRING ISN'T WHAT THEY'RE EMOTIONALLY GEARED FOR
THEY FIND IT REPUGNANT
DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE
MR. AMMAN FORTY NINE YEARS OLD SAID HE BELIEVES WESTERN UNION'S DEBT AND EQUITY HOLDERS WILL SUPPORT THE RESTRUCTURING
HE ADDED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS RUNNING SHORT OF CASH
WESTERN UNION HAS SAID THAT IF ITS PLANS ARE DEFEATED IT WILL FILE FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS
SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
ANOTHER BANK TRADER ATTRIBUTES THE DOLLAR'S REBOUND TO FEDERAL OFFICIALS' INCREASED OPENNESS ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITIES
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK RIGHT NOW THE TRADER SAYS
THEY WANT PEOPLE TO RUN OUT AND SAY THE FED'S BUYING THE FED'S BUYING
THAT'S WHAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FED'S INTERVENTION THIS YEAR
DOW PRESIDENT FRANK POPOFF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME INCREASES BOLSTERED EARNINGS
THE COMPANY'S STRONG COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS ALSO HELPED
COSTS REMAIN STABLE VOLUME HAS INCREASED AND THERE IS NO WEAKNESS APPARENT IN EITHER THE PRODUCT LINES OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MR. POPOFF SAID
FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOAR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
AND REVENUES SLUMP
BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS

DOCTOR SULLIVAN HAD CONCLUDED THAT EVEN IF HE PUSHED THE FULTON NOMINATION THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THE PRICE OF VICTORY WOULD BE TOO HIGH
HE WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE WRATH OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY MR. FULTON SAYS
BUT TEXAS AMERICAN MAY HAVE ITS PROBLEMS WITH THE PROPOSED COMBINATION OF REPUBLICBANK AND INTERFIRST
BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE ALONE THEY WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE STATE MR. GRANT ADDED
EXACTLY WHAT IMPACT THAT COMPETITION WILL HAVE IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS NOW HE SAID
EARLIER THIS FALL TANDON BORROWED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM FOOTHILL CAPITAL CORPORATION UNDER A SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT LINE OF AS MUCH AS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
ALSO A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SHORT TERM LOAN FROM XEROX CORPORATION WAS CONVERTED INTO A LONG TERM NOTE
THE NOTE IS CONVERTIBLE INTO TANDON COMMON STOCK
LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCIES OF THE U. S. AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED

MR. CRUZ SAID HE HAD SET DEADLINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORMS HE WAS PROPOSING
HE SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE EXPECTED THAT THE INTEGRATION OF THE NEW REBEL ARMY WOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF JUNE

<NOISE> THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
<NOISE> THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
<NOISE> FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
<NOISE> CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT

RICHARD ROSLUND A VICE PRESIDENT OF BLOCK TRADING AT KIDDER PEABODY SAID THE FED CHAIRMAN'S REMARKS GAVE THE MARKET A REASON TO ADOPT A MORE POSITIVE OUTLOOK
PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO GRASP ON HE SAID

MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
<NOISE> BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
THAT IS TWO TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID
<NOISE> CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
PERHAPS THE HOOVER OVERSEERS SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THEY PONDER THE LATEST AFFRONT TO GLENN CAMPBELL NEXT WEEK
THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
THE SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
SEPARATELY JUDGE BROWNING ISSUED A RULING ON THE AWARD OF ANY DAMAGES IN THE CASE
FOR CLAIMS IN THE FEDERAL CASE THE STANDARD OF DAMAGES IS OUT OF POCKET OR INVESTORS' LOSS ON THE BONDS
FOR WASHINGTON STATE CLAIMS THE STANDARD IS RECISSION WHICH COULD MEAN REPAYING BONDHOLDERS THEIR PURCHASE PRICE
THE DISPUTE IS A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MARKET PHILOSOPHIES
WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKETS
TOKYO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CLAIM TO FAVOR FREE MARKETS IN PRACTICE THEY OFTEN ARE LOATH TO RELINQUISH COMPLETE CONTROL ESPECIALLY IN PROMISING INDUSTRIES

FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A SHARE AFTER TAXES

ALBERT GROSS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT REFCO INCORPORATED AGREED
THE BOND MARKET WAS HELPED TEMPORARILY BY A DECLINE IN GOLD AND OTHER COMMODITY PRICES A STRENGTHENING DOLLAR AND STOCK MARKET RALLY HE SAID
<NOISE> BUT I EXPECT THE DOLLAR TO CONTINUE FALLING AND THAT WILL ACCELERATE INFLATION PRESSURES
THE BEST NUMBERS ON INFLATION ARE BEHIND US
MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS
BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY
THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK
BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
MR. REAGAN'S COMMENTS DON'T REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION AGREEMENT
AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE THE PLAN SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD EITHER SIGN OR VETO THE SPECIFIC TAXES CONGRESS CHOOSES
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID BEFORE THAT IT ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROVISION ON TAKEOVERS
HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR
THERE'S A LOT BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS
THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS
MOBIL BASED IN NEW YORK SAID ITS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME JUMPED NINETY TWO PERCENT
THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF REPLY
ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. *RATIO* DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
WHEN MS. HIGA TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX FROZEN PIZZA WAS STILL A LONG SHOT
THE AVERAGE JAPANESE DIDN'T HAVE FREEZER SPACE LET ALONE AN OVEN

SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
<NOISE> G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
A LOSS WASN'T UNEXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR
INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS A HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTIONS COULD LEAD TO A LEGAL REPRISALS
BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SAID MESSRS.
SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX *ARBITRAGERS* TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
CANDICE BERGEN AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM
I OFTEN THINK OBSERVED MS. BERGEN THAT IF DOSTOEVSKI HAD BEEN A SINGER HE'D HAVE SOUNDED LIKE RAY CHARLES
THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS
IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
AN EXXON *SPOKESWOMAN* SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE BE NO BIDS AT ALL
THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY
HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
WE'LL SEE
WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
<NOISE> SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY

THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF *REALTORS* IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR ALTERNATES TO THIS CONVENTION
DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SET WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID

RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT

THE BANK OF ITALY ALSO REPORTEDLY SOLD MARKS TO BUY ITALIAN LIRE
THE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MAINLY AT DEFENDING THE SAGGING LIRA IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH EIGHT EUROPEAN CURRENCIES FLOAT WITHIN SPECIFIED LIMITS
BUT THEY ALSO HAD THE EFFECT OF HELPING THE DOLLAR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF MARKS IN THE MARKET
<NOISE> FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT WHICH LIKE MR. KIRK RELISHES AN EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE THE OIL SPILL HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF ATTENTION
IN FACT WHEN WALL STREET LEARNED THAT THE PUBLICLY HELD COMPANY WAS HIRED TO HANDLE THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CLEANUP THE CONCERN'S STOCK SHOT UP ALMOST U- TEN PERCENT

MR. TUCKER'S HARD HITTING CAMPAIGN HAS IN TURN APPALLED TOP UNION LEADERS WHO SAY HE HAS TARNISHED THEIR REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT'S CLEANEST ORGANIZATIONS
THE STATEMENTS OF AN UNDEMOCRATIC UNION BEING IN BED WITH MANAGEMENT HURTS THIS UNION SAID MR. BIEBER
I RESENT THOSE STATEMENTS
MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OUTSTANDING IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST
ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A N- LONG TERM BASIS
AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A F:EW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
<NOISE> WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKROW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
<NOISE> I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
HE SAYS HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
THE P- COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
THE TRASH
PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN BOESKY WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON HUDSON HOWEVER WERE MAD
SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE TROUT TO THE FLY
SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
<NOISE> A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
<NOISE> A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION WHICH REQUIRES TIMEPLEX HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
AT THE MEETING SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO TWENTY MILLION FROM FIFTEEN MILLION
THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY BE USED FOR BENEFIT PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS
THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
THE U. S. OF COURSE HAS A VAST AND IN MANY PLACES EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
THE COUNCIL STUDY PUT A VALUE OF ONE TRILLION ON THE PARTS IT MEASURED
BUT GOVERNMENT OWNED FIXED CAPITAL S:UFFERS ALONG WITH PRIVATELY OWNED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WHEN ECONOMIC POLICIES DISCOURAGE LONG TERM INVESTMENT
THE GREATEST SCOURGE OF THE INVESTMENT IS OF COURSE INFLATION WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUFFER PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
<NOISE> USER FEES SIMPLY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE SOARING COSTS OF LOANS AND CONSTRUCTION
HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION HAD THE ADDED PROBLEM OF REDUCED YIELDS FROM GASOLINE TAXES BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENERGY SHORTAGES AND SHORTAGE ENFORCED CONSERVATION
<NOISE> THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT
<NOISE> THIS IT IS HOPED WILL HELP STOP INF(LATION)- HIGH INFLATION FROM SPIRALING INTO HYPERINFLATION
THE THINK TANK MEASURED EXPENSE RATIOS WHICH ARE A FUND'S OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS
FOR INVESTORS HIGH RATIOS ARE CLEARLY OF CONCERN
IT CUTS INTO POTENTIAL RETURN EVEN WHEN A FUND IS DOING WELL
<NOISE> AND IT LEAVES A FUND WITH LESS OF A CUSHION IN CASE PERFORMANCE SOURS
ALMOST UNNOTICED IN DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
INSTEAD WHAT SOME CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
<NOISE> NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
ABOUT EIGHT MILLION OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
N. E. C. CORP. AS ONE EXAMPLE BEGAN DONATING MONEY TO M. I. T. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
ONE DONATION OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS WENT TO CREATE A C. AND C. SOFTWARE PROFESSORSHIP
C. AND C. IS THE N. E. C. CORPORATE SLOGAN IT STANDS FOR COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS
<NOISE> THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
<NOISE> THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO U. S. INTELLIGENCE
THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT U. S. MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDING AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT

CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
<NOISE> EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION
SOME REPORTERS WERE MORE ORIGINAL
A PAIR FROM A LOCAL PAPER ASKED EDSEL IF HE FAVORED CASINO GAMBLING IN DETROIT A CONCEPT HEAVILY PROMOTED BY MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG
THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD
I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST
AND WHAT IF THE FOUNDRY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH CUMMINS'S DEMAND
MR. PATTERSON SAYS THE ENGINE COMPANY HAS BACKUP SUPPLIERS
BUT HE ADDS THAT BACKUP IS ALL OFFSHORE
<NOISE> PEOPLE ARE SCARED SAYS RICHARD ROSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN CHICAGO
WHEN THE MARKET GOES DOWN STOP ORDERS APPEAR LIKE CRAZY HE SAYS
<NOISE> AND IN A AND IN A VOLATILE UNCERTAIN MARKET LIKE THIS INVESTORS USE LIMIT ORDERS TO TRY TO MAKE SHORT TERM GAINS
ATTENDANTS IN SEARCH OF OTHER P. S. /SLASH TWO CLONES HERE HAVE TO C- SCOUR CAREFULLY

MAURICE LIPPENS CHAIRMAN OF BELGIUM'S GROUPE A. G. WHO TEAMED UP WITH THE SUEZ FOR THE GENERALE DE BELGIQUE STRUGGLE CONCURS
THEY'RE RATHER ALLERGIC TO ALL THAT HE SAYS
THEY HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF ETHICS
BUT THEY SHOWED THAT BEHIND THE STAID FACADE THEIR MINDS WERE CLICKING
<NOISE> IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
<NOISE> AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
BUT FRED MCINTYRE A RAILROAD WORKER IN OMAHA NEBRASKA VOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER INVEST IN THE MARKET AGAIN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
WITH GOOD REASON
AS BLACK MONDAY DAWNED HE HELD IN HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT A HANDSOME NEST EGG OF MORE THAN FOUR TIMES HIS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR PAY
THE NEXT DAY ALL OF IT WAS GONE AND HE OWED HIS BROKER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BOOT
DAVID MEISTER F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS A HALF DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
<NOISE> HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS

<NOISE> THE OFF:ICIAL ALSO SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY HAD BORROWED AND SOLD
STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
<NOISE> NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY
EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND O- CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND A HALF TO TWENTY ONE
BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
SOURCES SAID AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE THIS MORNING IN TORONTO FOLLOWED BY A NEWS CONFERENCE
BURNS FRY'S ABOUT SEVENTY MEMBER BOARD YESTERDAY WAS PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL BY ITS ELEVEN MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ALREADY HAS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION
SECURITY PACIFIC'S BOARD APPROVED THE TRANSACTION AT A MEETING A FEW DAYS AGO THE SOURCES SAID
THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAD BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
OFF THE HOOK THE RESIGNATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CRIMINAL DIVISION CHIEF WELD ERASES RHODE ISLAND REPUBLICAN'S SAINT GERMAIN'S RISK OF INDICTMENT FOR TAKING MEALS FROM LOBBYISTS
AGENCY LAWYERS WHO RAN A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION URGED NO ACTION CITING HOUSE RULES ALLOWING NEARLY UNLIMITED ENTERTAINMENT
WELD WAS RELUCTANT TO DROP THE CASE
ROBERT RAVITZ A GREY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT SAYS THE AGENCY DID THE BEST IT COULD BASED ON DRAWINGS OF THE COIN
RESPONDING TO MISS JONES'S COMMENTS HE SAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS WITH THE ARTWORK
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME CRUNCH
IF WE HAD LONGER TIME I'M SURE WE COULD HAVE MASSAGED THE ARTWORK TO DEATH
SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT ONCE AN UPSCALE PRODUCT PUTS ITS NAME ON LOWER PRICED GOODS IT CAN NEVER GO BACK UP
REVLON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING A LONG SHOT ATTEMPT TO REKINDLE THE HALSTON FLAME
REVLON OWNER OF HALSTON ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED HAS VISIONS OF SEEING HALSTON LABEL CLOTHES BACK IN BETTER DRESS DEPARTMENTS
BUT MARKETERS BELIEVE THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ITS SIX YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH RETAILER J. C. PENNEY COMPANY WHICH ENDED LAST YEAR
BUT WHEN LEVERAGED BUYOUT COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM LEVERAGED BUYOUTS ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
THEY'VE ADAPTED
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL T- RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORP.
THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORPORATION BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED HOW THE STATE SHOULD GET RID OF ITS HEFTY BUDGET SURPLUS NOW ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS
BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN REGISTERED DEMOCRATS SURVEYED BY THE FIELD INSTITUTE FAVORED GIVING THE MONEY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
BUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE THE MONEY TO BE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS
THAT APPEARS MORE IN LINE WITH REPUBLICAN THINKING
REPUBLICANS ASKED HOW TO DISBURSE THE SURPLUS SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PERSONAL TAX REBATES
HARRY TRUMAN WHISTLE STOPPED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAMPAIGNING AGAINST A PAROCHIAL DO NOTHING CONGRESS THAT WOULD NOT ENACT HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
HE STRUCK A CHORD IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET BUT ALSO DEFEATING SCORES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN THE PROCESS
TRUMAN RECOGNIZED THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS NOT JUST A RACE AMONG CANDIDATES BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE GREAT ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPER SEPARATION OF POWERS
THE CONTEST THEN ISN'T IDEOLOGICAL
IT'S CHARACTER PERSONALITY EXPERIENCE
IT'S CULTURAL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE
PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH UNDER THE AGREEMENT
IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS
THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS CANADIAN A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID
TRANSAMERICA SAID ITS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS ACHIEVED RECORD RESULTS IN THE QUARTER WITH CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE GROWING TO TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
ITS LEASING BUSINESS ALSO POSTED RECORD RESULTS
DEMAND FOR STANDARD CONTAINERS WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF STRONG WORLD TRADE TRANSAMERICA SAID
HOWEVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED COMPANY SAID ITS REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS REPORTED LOWER EARNINGS
THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
COULD BE
CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
<NOISE> WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG BADLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAD BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN
NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD *IDEA* OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
INTERCO SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITS INTERCO SUBSIDIARY INCORPORATED UNIT TERMINATED ITS TENDER OFFER FOR ALL LANE COMMON SHARES AT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
THE OFFER WAS SET TO EXPIRE MONDAY
ANY SHARES TENDERED TO INTERCO UNDER THE OFFER WILL BE RETURNED TO LANE SHAREHOLDERS INTERCO SAID
NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
YEAH SAID MR. IACOCCA
MAYBE
MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. IACOCCA WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS
EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE SIGNED A NEW FOUR YEAR CONTRACT WITH CHRYSLER
AND IN TUESDAY'S INTERVIEW MR. IACOCCA MAINTAINED THAT HE WANTS TO LEAD THE COMPANY INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES
NEITHER THE VOLUNTEER DOCTORS NOR THE SCIENTISTS CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT KNEW WHICH VOLUNTEERS WERE TAKING ACTIVE ASPIRIN AND WHICH WERE TAKING PLACEBOS
HOWEVER A SEPARATE COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO MONITOR THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT AS IT PROCEEDED
IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE THAT IN DECEMBER DECIDED THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE ASPIRIN IN REDUCING HEART ATTACKS WERE SO CLEAR THERE WASN'T ANY NEED TO CONTINUE THE EXPERIMENT
IT'S A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE FACE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY OVERHANG SAYS MORGAN STANLEY'S MR. ROACH
A SLOWING OF GROWTH IN PRODUCTION GIVES COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO WORK OFF SOME INVENTORY
<NOISE> AND ECONOMISTS NOTE THAT THE STEADY OPERATING RATE INDICATES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
THE FOLLOWING DAY MR. LI MARCHED TO CITY HALL HIS AGING PASTRIES IN HAND AND DUMPED THEM ON THE DESK OF THE SURPRISED MAYOR
THE MARKETS ARE FULL OF POOR QUALITY PASTRIES MR. LI PROCLAIMED
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION
AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR HA- TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISKS
THE FIRM IS A BIG GOVERNMENT BOND TRADER AND HAS GROWN A LOT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
AND AMONG MORGAN STANLEY'S BIGGEST PERCENTAGE GAINS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS EQUITY PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH NEARLY TRIPLED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE
IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A DIVE ON THIS ONE HE SAYS
I'M A LITTLE SCARED
I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
JONES INTERCABLE ALSO BOUGHT SEVERAL SYSTEMS SERVING TWELVE THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN AREA
IT MADE THE ACQUISITION ON BEHALF OF JONES CABLE INCOME FUND ONE B. C. VENTURE <NOISE> A JOINT VENTURE OF TWO INTERCABLE MANAGED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
THE PURCHASE WAS FROM OMEGA AFFILIATES
DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER

THE DELAY IS A VICTORY ALBEIT TEMPORARY FOR MR. TRUMP WHO OWNS TWO ATLANTIC CITY CASINO HOTELS
BALLY'S AGREEMENT TO BUY THE GOLDEN NUGGET IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT THE GOLDEN NUGGET PURCHASE BE BLOCKED CAME AS PART OF A COUNTERSUIT HE FILED AGAINST BALLY IN DECEMBER CHALLENGING A BALLY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN
BALLY HAD EARLIER SUED MR. TRUMP ALLEGING VARIOUS SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
THE OUTLOOK IN THE SENATE IS STILL CLOUDY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CONTINUES TO OPPOSE A TAX BOOST
STILL SENATE BUDGET WRITERS ARE INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THEIR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE
<NOISE> SUCH A BUDGET ITEM WOULD FORCE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO COME UP WITH A TAX INCREASE OF SOME KIND
THE HYUNDAI THAT NIFTY AND CHEAP LITTLE KOREAN CAR HAS CAUGHT ON IN THE U. S. AND NO DOUBT COULD COMPETE IN ANY MARKET IN THE WORLD
SO OUR WILLIAM EH- MCGURN INQUIRED INTO HOW MANY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED FROM KOREA TO JAPAN
HE FOUND THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE NUMBER WAS ZERO
THIS WAS DOWN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN EXPORTS REACHED ONE SOLD TO MITSUBISHI
EXPORTS LOST TO TOUGHER COMPETITION ABROAD AND MORE IMPORTS INTO THE U. S. MARKET HAVE CAUSED MANY FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR TRADITIONAL FAITH IN FREE TRADE
FROM SUGAR LONG PROTECTED <NOISE> TO WHEAT TO FLOWERS FARMERS ARE DEMANDING THAT BORDERS BE CLOSED
THE LOSERS PARTICULARLY IN SUGAR <NOISE> ARE MANY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE DESPERATE ECONOMIES THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS OTHERWISE TRYING TO SALVAGE
<NOISE> TOTAL PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION INCREASED ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST AFTER A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP IN JULY
OUTLAYS FOR PUBLIC BUILDING INCREASED ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER A ONE POINT TWO PERCENT RISE
<NOISE> OVERALL AUGUST OUTLAYS WERE ONE POINT ONE PERCENT ABOVE A YEAR EARLIER
THE HUGE GAP <NOISE> TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES W- WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
THE JOURNAL NEVER CAN BE ALL THINGS TO ALL READERS
IT DOESN'T TRY TO BE
WE ARE NOT PLANNING SPORTS SECTIONS OR LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE COLORED WEATHER MAPS OR STORIES ON EVERY MINOR CRISIS IN THE WORLD
WE DO INTEND TO REMAIN AMERICA'S NATIONAL BUSINESS DAILY AND WITH OUR EXPANDING ASIAN AND EUROPEAN EDITIONS THE GLOBAL BUSINESS DAILY AS WELL
THAT MEANS FOCUSING FIRMLY ON NEWS THAT BUSY BUSINESS PEOPLE TRULY NEED
STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY

EARNING IN THE PAST WE HAVE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION

BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN DELAWARE'S COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEYS FROM A DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
THUS THE CASE WOULD CL- WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD A:CTED ILLEGALLY DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER'S RIGHTS PLANS TO TWENTY PERCENT
PREVIOUSLY THE RIGHT OR POISON PILL WAS TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY ONLY IF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STOCKS WERE IN HOSTILE HANDS
S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION

FINALLY THERE'S THE WELFARE PROBLEM
NOT ALL WORKERS ARE AS LUCKY AS JOSEPH
SOME GET SICK OR INJURED OR LOSE THEIR JOBS
OTHERS WHO TURNED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS OVER TO BROKERS IN ORDER TO GET HELP HERE DISCOVERED THAT PROMISES OF MONEY MEALS AND LODGINGS WERE BOGUS
FEAR OF DEPORTATION PREVENTS THEM FROM GOING TO THE POLICE OR HELP
THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF WORKERS STARVING TO DEATH HERE
BUT SOME ARGUE AGENDA WOULD BE A BIG HIT AND CREATE NEW CATEGORY OF SOFTWARE
THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY TH- NEW AND DIFFERENT
IT IS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING SAYS ESTHER DYSON EDITOR OF RELEAS:E ONE POINT OH A NEWSLETTER THAT COVERS COMPUTER SOFTWARE

HOWEVER THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS ENOUGH TO BEGIN MARKETING THE PLASTIC IN TWO TO FIVE YEARS
MR. HEFTER OF JEFFERIES SAYS THAT INVESTORS ARE BASICALLY PICKING SOME STOCKS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SITUATIONS GOING THAT THEY HAVE A DE- DEFINITE IDEA ABOUT

THERE IS NO REAL PRESSURE TO JUMP INTO THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
MR. BETHELL HAS AN EYE FOR THE FASHIONABLE AND THE *ABOMINABLE* WHICH TODAY ARE OFTEN THE SAME THING
HE OBVIOUSLY RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT AND SAYING NO TO *CULTURAL* BARBARIANS AND THE CURRENT WISDOM
HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND A SCALPEL AS HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
THE BIG ATTRACTION IS THAT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SUMMER OLYMPICS AREN'T REALLY BEING HELD THIS IN THE SUMMER
G. M. WHICH HAS LOST ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE U. S. CAR MARKET IS RE- IN RECENT YEARS FIGURES THE GAMES' LATE SEPTEMBER TIMING IS IDEAL
IT ALSO HOPES THE GAMES WILL ATTRACT UPSCALE VIEWERS WHO NORMALLY DON'T TUNE INTO SPORTS

BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES
AND THE CORRUPTION PROBLEM SEEMED ONLY TO GET WORSE
GETTING THE DEAL RIGHT IS THE KEY
UNLIKE WARRANTS ON JAPANESE STOCKS DEALS FOR U. S. COMPANIES AREN'T REALLY COVERED BY THE OWNERSHIP OF UNDERLYING SHARES
INSTEAD UNDERWRITERS USE WHAT THEY CALL DYNAMIC HEDGE
EACH IS DIFFERENT BUT USUALLY INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF STOCK OPTION PURCHASES ARRANGED BY THE HOME OFFICE IN NEW YORK
SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACES ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EX:ERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES

BUT THIS WAS FAIRLY MINOR
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
BY NOW THERE IS LITTLE ELSE MR. FALCIGNO CAN DO TO HYPE ATTENDANCE
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T HAVE OTHER WORRIES

THE REACTION FROM THE FREE WORLD SHE WROTE AND THE LEADERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN LITTLE
THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR *INTERNAL* AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
ANALYST THOMAS ROONEY OF DONALDSON LUFKIN AND JENRETTE GOT SCORES OF CALLS FROM CLIENTS ABOUT THE RUMORS
HE ESTIMATES PRIME'S DOMESTIC DO- BUSINESS MAY BE OFF TWENTY PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WITH FOREIGN SALES UP BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
DOMESTIC SALES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF PRIME'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REVENUE
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES

CONGRESS'S JOINT TAX COMMITTEE NOW IS WITHOUT A S- CHIEF STAFF
DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICE OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
HIS SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHE(THER)- THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE E- ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDER ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE L- PAST THREE YEARS
BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS HAD A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATE DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT A PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INC. AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN HIS CRITICISM
HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN ALL NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF OTHER L- UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAID BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
<NOISE> IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENT SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
THE REASSURING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HAND ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS A CAUSE FOR HOPE
GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHEAD WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAID REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR HAND BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. <NOISE> GENERAL JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
<NOISE> IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
<NOISE> HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
<NOISE> RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF THE EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENED TO THE COMPANY
<NOISE> UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WILL CONTRIBUTE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE <NOISE> FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY IN THE COMPANY
FRANK PEREZ A RETIRED DIPLOMAT RECALLS THE DAY HE LEFT FOR A TWO YEAR STINT AS A DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN *TURKEY*
FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAID SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS S- SOGGY AND MOLDY
WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT DOESN'T MATTER
IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE EAT CAVIAR WORE BILL BLASS THE *COLUMNIST* SAYS
FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
GENLYTE DESIGNS AND MAKES LIGHTING FIXTURES AND ELECTRICAL LIGHTING CONTROLS
OTHER BARINCO UNITS MAKE ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING SYSTEMS
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE NEW YORK BASED BARINCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION OR TWO <NOISE> POINT SIX EIGHT DOLLARS PER SHARE
<NOISE> THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
<NOISE> TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO *COUNTENANCE*
BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED *TRIGGERING* A CLAMOR FROM BOTH THE CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAP IS CONFLICTING
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THE COCKPIT ALARM SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO THE IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE BILL EARLY IN SEPTEMBER LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
WHILE THE E- ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL PROVISION MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS A ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SHOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITIES CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY RESULT OF RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DANSFORTH'S NATIONWIDE NOW NOW ISMS
THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUES BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
IN THE LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
ONCE A SOFTWARE STAR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN *BUFFETED* BY GROWING COMPETITION IN ITS CORE DATABASE BUSINESS
LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
IN NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK OF SALOMON BROTHERS <NOISE> WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR O- OPERATIONS
MR. *FREIMAN* WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH TOUGH CALLS
EMOTIONAL UPSETS HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
*I* TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT *WITHIN* REASON
NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT *RISKS* HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR THE EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASE BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
<NOISE> AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION IN DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION THIS YEAR
SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
MR. HARRIS SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
THE FINANCIAL *RESTRUCTURING* IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENA
<NOISE> THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANT TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
<NOISE> OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST <NOISE> WASTE MANAGEMENT BOARD MEETS
CHEMLAWN IS DISCUSSED ONLY BRIEFLY AND IS RULED OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET BY MR. BUNTROCK

I DON'T KNOW IF *JESSE* JACKSON EVER DREAMED OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE GROWING UP POOR AND BLACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA
I DO KNOW HE NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE EASY OR QUICK
I HOPE MR. JACKSON WILL FORGIVE ME IF I ASSUME THAT HE IS WILLING TO WAIT ANOTHER EIGHT YEARS WHILE KEEPING HIS EYE ON THE PRIZE
SOUTHWESTERN BELL HAS THIRTY DAYS TO CONTEST THE COMPLAINT
COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A FINAL DECISION BY THE END OF THE YEAR
GENERALLY THOUGH THE AGENCY'S STAFF IS VIEWS AS AGGRESSIVE IN ITS RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMISSION HAS USUALLY APPROVED FAR MORE MODEST CUTS FOR REGULATED COMPANIES
WE HAVE FREEDOM IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IT STINKS SAID ELEVEN YEAR OLD SEAL HOOKS
DRUGS ALCOHOL CRIME
<NOISE> THERE'S NO GOOD NEWS ANYMORE
I'M HOPING WE GET A PRESIDENT WHO CLEANS OUT AMERICA
DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
THE POST HAS BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN A DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
<NOISE> THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COST EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OF OMISSION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
<NOISE> I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
<NOISE> A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
A JUDGE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELFTH
AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
<NOISE> ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS PER TON PROFIT
TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
<NOISE> SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS
WE'LL TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE JUST WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
<NOISE> BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
<NOISE> WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
<NOISE> THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
<NOISE> AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
ON THE SURFACE THE TRADE REPORT LOOKED ENCOURAGING
THE NATION'S SEASONALLY ADJUSTED TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED TO EIGHT POINT ONE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN JUNE THE LOWEST MONTHLY DEFICIT SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT ZERO TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TEN POINT TWO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ORIGINALLY REPORTED
SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
<NOISE> BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
<NOISE> MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR

CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SUGGEST IRAN IS THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZING TERRORIST STRIKES AGAINST AMERICAN WEST EUROPEAN AND ARAB TARGETS
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALERTED EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES OF AN INCREASED THREAT

<NOISE> WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
HOWEVER THE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING
THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND THE FURTHER AMOUNT REQUIRED IS EXPECTED TO FLOW FROM THE PROCEEDS OF OVERSEAS REINSURANCE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE
TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
THIRTY ONE TEAMS OF NINETEEN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND ASSORTED OTHER GROUPS SIGNED UP FOR THE FIRST LOCAL COMPETITION
FOR WEEKS DRUMS WERE HEARD ALONG THE WILLAMETTE AS THE TEAMS PRACTICED
BOATS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN IN BUSINESS SUITS FRESH FROM WORK OR HAPPY HOUR WERE NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT
THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
<NOISE> IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR V.
MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP

AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAYS OF L. T. V.'S FILING
AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
<NOISE> IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED

THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID

FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM
MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS
HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX

TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN ASEAN POWERS
SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
<NOISE> SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA

BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION

I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE *LIQUIDITY* THROUGHOUT ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY

A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON

NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RE- RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK

THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FORTY THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH

BUT THE TRADE FIGURES COULD BE AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON INTEREST RATES MANY ANALYSTS SAY
IF THE JANUARY DEFICIT TURNS OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GAP THAT MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE DOLLAR MIGHT RESUME ITS FALL
THAT COULD ALARM FOREIGN INVESTORS AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM ADDING TO THEIR HOLDINGS OF DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS

I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE T- TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD HYMAN OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INCORPORATED SAYS
REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS USUALLY IS WRONG
THE MARKETS SEEMED DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
<NOISE> WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE

BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
<NOISE> THERE ARE G- SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSISTENTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN A. INSTEAD OF *PLASMINOGEN* PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF L. P. A. ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
HOWEVER HE LEAVES PRIME AT A DIFFICULT TIME
THE COMPUTER MARKET IS GROWING SLOWLY AND PRIME'S PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS ARE LOSING GROUND TO INDUSTRY STANDARD COMPUTERS THAT USE THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM

DETAILS ARE STILL MURKY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CREDITS
ITALIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT ROME'S DECISION TO GRANT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GUARANTEE OF EXPORTS CREDIT WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A *BANKING* DECISION

STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
YESTERDAY THE AGENCY REVERSED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FINDING THAT MEREDITH HAD VIOLATED THE DOCTRINE
THE SO CALLED FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS A MISNOMER SAID DIANE KILLORY THE AGENCY'S GENERAL COUNSEL
IT PROMOTES BLANDNESS AND NOTHINGNESS BY CHILLING THE VERY SPEECH IT WAS MEANT TO FOSTER
IN SOME SECTORS THOUGH INTRIGUING OPTIONS ARE SPRINGING UP
INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR MAJOR BROKERAGES SCREEN MONEY MANAGERS FOR POTENTIAL CLIENTS
SOME HAVE CREATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT POOL THE MONEY OF INVESTORS WITH SIMILAR INVESTMENT GOALS
THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE THEN MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS
ANNUAL FEES FOR SUCH ACCOUNTS HOWEVER OFTEN RUN AS HIGH AS THREE PERCENT INCLUDING TRANSACTION COSTS
A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS

I SAY THE ONLY WAY I COULD HELP HIM IS WITH A GARBAGE TRUCK TO HAUL AWAY THE OLD COMPUTER MANUALS THAT LITTER HIS APARTMENT
ALL THE GAINS THAT WE ARE MAKING ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SAYS F. JAMES MCDONALD G. M.'S PRESIDENT
THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAPPENING IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. TODAY
INDEED THE ERA OF BIG TIME NATIONAL LABOR TALKS IN WHICH UNION AND MANAGEMENT LEADERS BUTT HEADS OVER PENNIES AN HOUR IS WANING
EVEN LESS APPRECIATED IS THE TURMOIL THAT OFTEN RESULTS FOR WOMEN

SHE SAYS IT WAS A WONDERFUL RELIEF WHEN DOCTORS TRACED HIS PROBLEM TO NERVE DAMAGE FROM BACK SURGERY AND TREATED IT WITH A MUSCLE RELAXING DRUG
A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE
THAT TEST WAS LESS THAN A COMPLETE SUCCESS
DIRT THAT ACCUMULATED IN THE KENAF DURING HARVESTING WASN'T ALL REMOVED AND ENDED UP IN THE PAPER
THE KENAF ALSO JAMMED IN SOME EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN CUT IN LENGTHS THAT WERE SEVERAL FEET LONG
BY SEPTEMBER THE WEAKNESS OF COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES FINALLY SURFACED
IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING INFLATION FEARS GERMANY AND JAPAN BEGAN TIGHTENING MONETARY POLICY AND RAISING INTEREST RATES

COMPUTERVISION THE PIONEER IN THE COMPUTERIZED DESIGN MARKET HAS HAD POOR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN RECENT YEARS AS IT REVAMPED ITS AGED PRODUCT LINE
HOWEVER RECENTLY IT HAS REPORTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED EARNINGS
ALTHOUGH IT HAS SLIPPED FROM FIRST TO THIRD IN SIZE IN THE INDUSTRY IT RETAINS A SUBSTANTIAL BASE OF CUSTOMERS
BUT WITH THE IMPORTED DOGS CAME PROBLEMS
ONE WAS COST
WHENEVER THEY STRAY FROM THE COUNTRY'S COOL CAPITAL THE NORTHERN BREED DOGS NEED AIR CONDITIONED ACCOMMODATIONS
SPECIAL VEHICLES HAVE BEEN BUILT TO SQUIRE THEM AROUND
EACH DOG NEEDS A TRAINER
A COOK PREPARES THE DOG CHOW
UPKEEP RUNS TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH PER CANINE TRIPLE THE SALARIES OF THE TRAINERS
ASKED ABOUT A NEW PRESIDENTIAL AID REQUEST JIM WRIGHT TALKED ABOUT MORALITY
IF I SCHEDULE IT THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE SOME MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PASS IT HE SAID
I DON'T WANT TO RUN IT OUT THERE AND BE DEFEATED AGAIN
MR. WRIGHT SHOULD BE LESS TIMID IN HIS CONVICTIONS
AFTER ALL HE ISN'T THE ONE WHO HAS TO RISK GETTING HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A METAL PIPE
A FALLING DOLLAR IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE U. S. IMPORTS MORE EXPENSIVE DECREASING DEMAND FOR THEM
BUT SOME FOREIGN PRODUCERS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO ADJUST PRICES TO REFLECT THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR CONTRIBUTING TO THE PERSISTENT GROWTH IN U. S. IMPORTS
IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS IMPORT PRICES HAVE CLIMBED SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT WHILE THE DOLLAR HAS FALLEN NINE POINT NINE PERCENT
GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
THE DEPUTY TREASURER DID IT SAYS FRANK KEEFE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MASTERMIND
HE OBVIOUSLY MUST BE DOING IT BECAUSE IT IS A PRUDENT AND PROFESSIONAL THING TO DO
AS FOR HIMSELF MR. KEEFE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE'S LEAVING HIS POST IN DECEMBER
BY THEN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH RECONVENES TODAY TO PICK UP THE BUDGET MESS WILL BE PLAYING WHAT DID THE GOVERNOR KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT
THE WORD IS TERROR
MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT SPENDING WOULD FALL SIX PERCENT OR ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO TWENTY FOUR POINT SIX THREE BILLION DOLLARS
AMTRAK SUBSIDIES WOULD BE ELIMINATED AND THE PASSENGER RAILROAD'S ASSETS SOLD BRINGING IN AN ESTIMATED ONE BILLION DOLLARS
BUT CONGRESS IS LIKELY TO BALK AND FINDING A BUYER FOR THE MONEY LOSING RAILROAD MAY BE TOUGH
THE BUDGET ALSO WOULD END DISCRETIONARY GRANTS FOR TRANSIT SYSTEMS AND CLOSE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION
CONGRESS HAS REJECTED SIMILAR CUTS BEFORE
MR. FUNARO DESCRIBED AS HOT AIR AND NONSENSE FOREIGN BANKERS' LANGUAGE IN THEIR S- CRITICISM OF BRAZIL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC POLICY
HE SAID NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT BRAZIL'S HIGH INFLATION WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING BIG SURPLUSES TO MEET DEBT PAYMENTS

BUT THE CORPSE WAS SOON WALKING
DURING THE PROGRESSIVE ERA PRESSURE FOR MORE FEDERAL SPENDING DEVELOPED

KIMBERLY CLARK POSSESSED THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY SUPER ABSORBENT POLYMERS WHICH REPLACED SOME OF THE BULKY FLUFF AND WAS EVEN USING IT IN ITS ADULT INCONTINENCE PRODUCTS
BUT THE COMPANY DELAYED ITS PLANS FOR THIN BABY DIAPERS WHEN RESEARCH SHOWED THAT PARENTS DIDN'T THINK DIAPERS WERE ABSORBENT UNLESS THEY DOUBLED THE SIZE OF BABY'S BOTTOM
THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED
UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE

STANLEY NABI EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF BESSEMER SAID THEY'RE NOT REDUCING THEIR OFFER IF YOU CALCULATE THE OFFER'S VALUE AS OF THURSDAY'S CLOSE
I FIGURE IT WAS WORTH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON THURSDAY
WITH FRIDAY'S REVISION IT'S WORTH SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
THE REVISED TERMS ARE NO LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL TERMS IN THE POST CRASH MARKET
THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE ANALYSTS
IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
<NOISE> TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS

HE'S ANALYTICALLY TOUGH HE'LL NEVER TAKE A STORY AT ITS FACE VALUE SAYS A TRADER
MR. MCNAY ALSO IS RESPECTED AS A MANAGER WHO MAKES DECISIONS QUICKLY
IF A STORY MAKES SENSE JOE WILL BE THE FIRST TO PUT IN AN ORDER THE TRADER ADDS
HE BRINGS THAT ATTITUDE TO THE OFFICE
THE LUNCHROOM IN THE SPRAWLING COMPANY OFFICE BUILDING IN THIS NORTH DALLAS SUBURB HAS A FREE ICE CREAM MACHINE AND A TEN CENT COKE DISPENSER
FOR CHRISTMAS LAST YEAR HE GAVE ALL SEVENTY EMPLOYEES VIDEOCASSETTE RECORDERS AND SET UP A FREE VIDEO LIBRARY WITH ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MOVIES

N. F. L. TEAMS REPORTED THOUSANDS OF REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS AND SAID THEY EXPECTED THOUSANDS MORE
THE BIGGEST SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TALKS THEN MAY BE HINTS FOR GRAPPLING WITH COMPETITIVENESS
THESE NEGOTIATIONS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW ARE WE GOING TO ACHIEVE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH SAYS MR. MEYER

MRS. AQUINO S- UNDERSTANDS CORRECTLY THAT AS THE ELECTED PRESIDENT SHE IS ABOVE SUCH NONSENSE
HER RESPONSIBILITY IS TO THE VOTERS WHO RECOGNIZED THE NATION'S DESPERATE NEED FOR REFORM AND GAVE HER THEIR MANDATE
TO AVOID MORE OUTBURSTS SUCH AS MR. LAUREL'S IT'S TIME THAT MRS. AQUINO STARTED USING THAT MANDATE
MR. LENNANE HAS STARTED THE BIDDING IN JUNE BY PROPOSING TO TAKE THE COMPANY PRIVATE FOR SEVEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE

METRO RICHELIEU OFFICIALS WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THE POSSIBLE SALE OF THE STEINBERG OPERATION
RICHARD SUTTON PROVIGO'S TREASURER SAID IF AND WHEN IT COMES ON THE MARKET WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOK AT IT

<NOISE> THE G. O. P. SEEMS PRIMED IN OTHER WORDS FOR A REPLAY OF OLD VALUES THEMES
BUT A PARADOX ARISES
<NOISE> MR. BUSH NEVER WAS STRONGLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE WING OF THE PARTY
MR. REAGAN HIMSELF WHEN HE GOT IN OFFICE PUT ITS ISSUES ON THE BACK BURNER
HIS ANNOUNCED PURPOSE WILL BE TO RALLY THE PARTY AND GIVE A BOOST TO THE CANDIDACY OF GEORGE BUSH TO SUCCEED HIM
THIS HE UNDOUBTEDLY WILL TRY TO DO FOR THE POLITICS OF THE DEMOCRATS' MICHAEL DUKAKIS IS HARDLY IN THE REAGAN MOLD
BUT THE PRESIDENT I DARE PREDICT WILL TRY TO GIVE MR. BUSH A BOOST BY SPEAKING WITH PRIDE OF HIS OWN EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE

THE BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE THE LARGEST IN HISTORY CAME AFTER BOTH FIRMS APPARENTLY R- REMAINED ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS APART IN SETTLEMENT TALKS
THOUGH THE FILING COMPLICATES THE BATTLE MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE NEITHER COMPANY WILL EMERGE THE WINNER
THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT NI- THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR VERSUS
MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY THE STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
<NOISE> THE SYSTEM ISN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
<NOISE> ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
<NOISE> OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF <NOISE> OR IF THE WOR(K)- IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY
<NOISE> BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAD TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
<NOISE> BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
<NOISE> BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR
AS A RESULT THERE IS A THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING
<NOISE> AND THAT COULD LEAD THE FED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES IN AN EFFORT TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY IN THE COMING MONTHS
TO BE SURE A FEW COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO USE THE OLYMPICS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM A SUBCONTRACTOR <NOISE> TO AN INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN BRAND
KUKJE CORPORATION SHIFTED FROM PRODUCING NIKE SHOES TO DEVELOPING ITS OWN PRO SPECS LINE OF ATHLETIC SHOES FIVE YEARS AGO
IT PAID FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND GOODS TO BE AN OFFICIAL SPONSOR OF THE GAMES AND HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE LOGO IN ITS ADVERTISING
KUKJE HOPES THE OLYMPICS WILL HELP GIVE PRO SPECS A FOOTHOLD IN EUROPE
<NOISE> <NOISE> THE NEW EMPHASIS ON MAKING SCHOOLS WORK HAS PUSHED ASIDE SOME OTHER LONGSTANDING SCHOOL DEBATES
DESEGREGATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS REMAINS A GOAL BUT IS ENTIRELY ELUSIVE IN MANY AREAS
MANY FAMILIES THAT COULD WHITE OR BLACK FLED TO SUBURBAN PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS AS BUSING ALONE BECAME A MORE DISCUSSED ISSUE THAN SCHOOL CURRICULA
WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS YONKERS AND KANSAS CITY FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE LEARNED TO ESCHEW THEIR TRAGIC SOCIAL ENGINEERING
<NOISE> MOST NOW LEAVE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ALONE TO ATTRACT STUDENTS BACK NOT DRIVE THEM OUT
<NOISE> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RECESSION LIKE DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE STATISTICS SAID NORMAN ROBINSON <NOISE> CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MELLON BANK CORPORATION
AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE FED WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A FAMILIAR WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE
SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
THE REPORT DOESN'T INCLUDE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S OWN VERSION OF EVENTS
DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE A VERSION OF THE EVENTS
I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOES SAID MR. MATHES
HE SAID THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PLEASED THAT THE REPORT HAD BEEN RELEASED BECAUSE MR. REAGAN WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
CAPTAIN OVERHEARING THE RADIO DISCUSSION ABOUT RUNWAY FIVE I UNDERSTOOD NOTHING
AND WHAT RUNWAY
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
LAST MONTH'S SURGE WAS WIDESPREAD WITH AUTO SALES RISING ONE POINT NINE PERCENT BUILDING MATERIALS ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AND FURNITURE CLIMBING POINT SEVEN PERCENT
THE ONLY NOTICEABLE DECLINES WERE IN RESTAURANTS POINT SIX PERCENT AND FOOD STORES POINT THREE PERCENT
EXCLUDING AUTOS SALES ROSE POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST MONTH
<NOISE> IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
CHRISTIANS AND MOSLEMS MARCHED ACROSS BEIRUT'S SECT- SECTARIAN DEMARCATION LINE TO PROTEST LEBANON'S ECONOMIC CRISIS
ABOUT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE RALLY
LEBANON'S CURRENCY HAS LOST ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT AGAINST THE VALUE OF THE U. S. DOLLAR THIS YEAR AND THE INFLATION RATE IS ESTIMATED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PERCENT
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION MR. WORSECK CONTINUED
THEY ARE CONCERNED WHETHER THE DOLLAR WILL GO INTO THE TANK AGAIN
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE OVERREACTING
CHRYSLER IS RESUMING EXPORTS TO EUROPE AFTER ITS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FORCED IT TO LEAVE THE MARKET
THE COMPANY PLANS TO SHIP VERSIONS OF ITS DODGE SHADOW DODGE DAYTONA SHELBY Z. PLYMOUTH VOYAGER AND THE LEBARON SEDAN COUPE AND CONVERTIBLE
<NOISE> THE CARS WILL BE F- WILL BE SOLD FIRST IN WEST GERMANY BELGIUM AUSTRIA THE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND
THE ROAD NAMED WEST STREET IS A NARROW STRIP OF RED GRAVEL
IT IS LIKE THE PROVERBIAL RAILROAD TRACKS IN AMERICA THAT SEPARATE THE RICH SIDE OF TOWN FROM THE POOR
PHYSICAL DISTANCE MAY NOT BE GREAT BUT THE MENTAL GAP IS
THE HONDURAN LEGISLATOR AGAIN I'M ALMOST CONVINCED THAT THE SANDINISTAS ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER
I THINK WE SHOULD GO INTO A PEACE PROCESS WITH THEM
I DON'T SEE OURSELVES GOING INTO A WAR AND THE AMERICANS DON'T SEE THEMSELVES GOING INTO A VIETNAMA- VIETNAM TYPE WAR IN CENTRAL AMERICA
SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONV- CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN MARKET ECONOMY
BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEME- SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
<NOISE> SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
<NOISE> <NOISE> BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
ROGER AILES THE MAN WHO WILL GUIDE GEORGE BUSH'S HEAVY MEDIA CAMPAIGN IS PUMPING UP HIS ANGER LIKE A LINEMAN PREPARING TO CRUSH THE OPPOSING QUARTERBACK
MICHAEL DUKAKIS HAS THE TOUGHEST KNEES AND ELBOWS TODAY SAID THE NEW YORK ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE WHO ONCE PITCHED NIXOR- RICHARD NIXON AS WARM
HE'S THE MEANEST LITTLE SON OF A BITCH I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN POLITICS
MOANS STAN TRILLING A LONGTIME O. T. C. STOCKBROKER AT PAINEWEBBER IN IN LOS ANGELES IT'S LIKE I KNOW THERE'S A PARADE OUT THERE <NOISE>
I CAN HEAR THE BAND MARCHING BY
<NOISE> BUT THEY WON'T LET ME IN THE PARADE
THE OVERALL MARKET IS BEING DRIVEN BY THESE BIG CAP TAKEOVER STOCKS BUT I'M NOT PARTICIPATING
MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT
<NOISE> IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HE WAS A GLOBALLY MINDED FINANCE MINISTER UNDER PIERRE TRU- TRUDEAU
<NOISE> LIBERALS LED A ROYAL COMMISSION THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE ENDORSED FREE TRADE AS THE BEST WAY FOR CANADA TO REACH ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIAL
LIKE RICHARD GEPHARDT AND SOME OTHER U. S. DEMOCRATS MR. TURNER MUST BELIEVE PROTECTIONISM IS A HOT BUTTON TO POLITICAL OFFICE
<NOISE> INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
EUROPE BY CONTRAST OFFERS A CORNUCOPIA OF UNDERVALUED CORPORATIONS AND A WAVE OF INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING STEMMING FROM ITS DRIVE TOWARDS A SINGLE MARKET BY NINETEEN NINETY TWO
IN SPAIN U. S. INVESTMENT BANKS TOOK A HUGE CHUNK OF THE RECENT BATCH OF BANK MERGERS
SHEARSON HELPED ITALIAN FINANCIER CARLO DE BENEDETTI MAKE A PIONEERING ALBEIT UNSUCCESSFUL HOSTILE BID FOR THE GIANT BELGIAN HOLDING COMPANY <NOISE> SOCIETE GENERALE DE BELGIQUE LAST YEAR
THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
TEXAS STARTED EVALUATING POTENTIAL S. S. C. SITES ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW HAS SOLID DATA ON SIX LOCATIONS SAYS DILLARD HAMMETT STATE ENERGY ADVISER
FOUR MORE COMMUNITIES HAVE SINCE ASKED TO BE INCLUDED
CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FLAT RELATIVELY EARTHQUAKE FREE LANDSCAPE MR. HAMMETT SAYS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TEXAS COULD HAVE THE SITE
THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO A PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE TO AUGUSTA NATIONAL'S ACCENT ON EXPERIENCE
THE COLOR THAT'S SECOND ONLY TO GREEN HEREABOUTS IS GRAY
IT CAN BE FOUND MOSTLY ON THE HEADS OF PARTICIPANTS AND SPECTATORS
GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS
MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
<NOISE> HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
IN A LETTER TO SUPPORTERS MR. NUNN SAID HIS POSITION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE FORECLOSED A RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
<NOISE> IF I ATTEMPTED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND ALSO CARRY OUT MY SENATE DUTIES I WOULD WIND UP DOING NEITHER WELL HE WROTE
<NOISE> MR. NUNN ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ON MY FAMILY
THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS
SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
<NOISE> NICARAGUA'S SANDINISTAS BLAMED A HARDLINE CONTRA FACTION LED BY MILITARY COMMANDER ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ FOR SLOWING PROGRESS IN FOUR DAYS OF PEACE TALKS THAT ENDED MONDAY IN MANAGUA
NEGOTIATIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO CONTINUE NEXT WEEK
THEY SAID BERMUDEZ FAVORED CONTINUED MILITARY EFFORTS TO OUST THE RULING SANDINISTA REGIME
<NOISE> LAST YEAR SEVERAL MAJOR CITIES INCLUDING JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA AND CHARLOTTE N. C. PROHIBITED OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED CONSTRUCTION OF NEW OUTDOOR ADVERTISEMENTS
JUST LAST MONTH SAINT LOUIS ADOPTED A BILLBOARD BAN
AND OFFICIALS IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA AND DENVER ARE CONSIDERING CRACKING DOWN
WORLD BANK PRESIDENT BARBER CONABLE SAID THE BANK WILL SEND A DELEGATION TO ARGENTINA NEXT WEEK TO REVIEW THE MEASURES
IF THE BANK APPROVES THE DETAILS THE BRIDGE LOAN WOULD GO FORWARD AND THE WORLD BANK LOANS WOULD BE COMPLETED
A BANK SPOKESMAN SAID DETAILS OF THOSE LOANS WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL THE DELEGATION COMPLETES ITS WORK
ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
<NOISE> THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
<NOISE> IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I. B. M. HAS BOUGHT PIECES OF NEARLY A DOZEN COMPANIES STEPPING UP THE PACE IN RECENT MONTHS
<NOISE> THE COMPUTER GIANT IS MAINLY TRYING TO BUY TECHNOLOGY OR EXPERTISE IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS SOFTWARE FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE CASE OF ITS POLICY MANAGEMENT STAKE
I. B. M. ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO BUY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS' LOYALTY IN THE INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY
<NOISE> INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
<NOISE> THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
<NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
THEY'VE ADAPTED
<NOISE> TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN MA- RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
<NOISE> WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
THE POINT VIRTUALLY EVERY ADVERTISER IN EVERY MEDIUM IS PAYING TO REACH VIEWERS OR READERS WHO NEVER BECOME CUSTOMERS
<NOISE> NO OTHER LIKELY BIDDERS STEPPED FORWARD WEDNESDAY
HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE ALMOST UNHEARD OF IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY
<NOISE> BUT ANALYSTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT EITHER FORD MOTOR COMPANY OR GENERAL ELECTRIC CORPORATION MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT WITH BOEING IF THE COMPANIES WERE INTERESTED
FORD FOR INSTANCE HAS INDICATED IT IS LOOKING FOR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS ACCUMULATED ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IT COULD USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES
A FORD SPOKESMAN CITING COMPANY POLICY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY SPECULATION ABOUT ITS INTEREST
G. E. DECLINED COMMENT BUT A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANY SAID IT ISN'T INTERESTED IN BOEING
PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURER FIREMAN'S FUND HAS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE MADE THREE UNFORESEEN ADDITIONS TO RESERVES FOR CLAIMS TOTALING MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> JOHN BYRNE FIREMAN'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE'S CONFIDENT FIREMAN'S IS USING E- EXCESS RESOURCES TO RETIRE STOCK
BUT HE CONCEDES BUY BACKS CAN BE RISKY FOR INSURERS
<NOISE> ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PRE PER SHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
MR. SCHMIED IS BEING TESTED EARLY IN A POSITION HE DIDN'T SEEM EAGER TO OCCUPY
ANALYSTS SAY HE IS AN OPERATIONS MAN WHO NEVER EXHIBITED ANY AMBITION TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE
I NEVER GOT THE OVERWHELMING SENSE THAT HE WAS EAGER TO SUCCEED MR. FLAVIN SAYS CHRISTOPHER DEMISCH AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION
MOREOVER MR. SAWYER ISN'T THOUGHT TO POSSESS A LOT OF CLOUT
<NOISE> HE DOESN'T FIT THE BOSS IMAGE THAT THE LATE MAYOR DALEY MADE FAMOUS AND THAT MAYOR WASHINGTON WAS BEGINNING TO ACQUIRE
HE'S A WEAK GUY SAYS MR. ROSE THE POLITICAL CONSULTANT SUBJECT TO A LOT OF PRESSURE AND OBVIOUSLY NOT A CRUSADER
ASKED HOW HE VIEWED THE PRUDENTIAL BACHE UNIT MR. WINTERS SAID ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR RESULTS
OF COURSE NOT
ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR DIRECTION
YES
MR. WINTERS ADDED THAT PRUDENTIAL BACHE MAY BE MORE DELIBERATE THIS YEAR IN SOME OF ITS EXPANSION
HE ALSO VOICED CONFIDENCE IN CHAIRMAN GEORGE BALL DESPITE THE LOSSES CALLING HIM THE MOST QUALIFIED GUY IN THE U. S.
<NOISE> FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS A NEW COMPETITOR IN THE BOOK CLUB FIELD IS A GODSEND
BOOK CLUB RIGHTS ARE SECOND ONLY TO PAPERBACK RIGHTS IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR PUBLISHERS
FURTHERMORE A BOOK CLUB IMPRIMATUR ON A BOOK GIVES IT ENORMOUS CACHET WITH BOOKSTORE MANAGERS
NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
<NOISE> IT WENT ON TO SAY THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
MANY BLAME THAT CHANGE ON SIMPLE GEOGRAPHY AND AN EFFORT TO MOVE AWAY FROM UNIONS
BUT SOME CRITICS ALSO ACCUSE THE JAPANESE COMPANIES OF DELIBERATELY AVOIDING BLACKS
HONDA AND THE U. S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION SETTLED A BIG RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CASE LAST MONTH
<NOISE> THE TWO LABORATORIES THAT NICHOLS PURCHASED ARE IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA AND SIOUX CITY IOWA
INITIAL PAYMENTS FOR THE LABS TOTALED ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND PREFERRED STOCK
ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO BE MADE OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD HAVE A CURRENT VALUE OF SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS NICHOLS SAID
THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE CONTINGENT UPON CERTAIN MATERIAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS OF THE TWO LABS REMAINING INTACT FOR THREE YEARS NICHOLS SAID
<NOISE> SINCE MONDAY'S OPENING BELL N. C. N. B. SHARES HAVE JUMPED FOUR AND THREE EIGHTHS POINTS CLOSING AT TWENTY SEVEN AND SEVEN EIGHTHS YESTERDAY
MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE STOCK COULD GO HIGHER SOON PERHAPS CROSSING THE THIRTY DOLLAR A SHARE BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR
LONG TERM BULLS PREDICT N. C. N. B.'S PRICE COULD EASILY DOUBLE AND SOME SAY TRIPLE
THE AGENCY HAS BEEN UNDER GROWING PRESSURE FROM REPRESENTATIVE JOHN DINGELL DEMOCRAT MICHIGAN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS TO TIGHTEN REGULATION OF THE GENERICS INDUSTRY
SENATOR ORRIN HATCH REPUBLICAN UTAH RANKING MINORITY MEMBER ON THE SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE WELCOMED THE PLAN
IT IS MY STRONG BELIEF THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN UNCOVERED TO WARRANT THESE CHANGES HE SAID IN A STATEMENT
IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SPOKESMAN
STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIKELY
SENATOR WILLIAM PROXMIRE DEMOCRAT WISCONSIN SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE FED FOR DROPPING THE M. ONE TARGET
HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT IT IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND UNWISE POLICY TO ALLOW M. ONE TO EXPAND AS RAPIDLY AS IT HAS
LAST YEAR M. ONE WHICH CONSISTS OF CHECKING DEPOSITS PLUS CASH HELD BY THE PUBLIC SOARED FIFTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
THAT WAS FAR ABOVE THE FED'S TARGET OF THREE PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT
WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
SOME HAVE CHARACTERIZED OUR COUNTERMEASURES AS PROTECTIONIST BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES
THAT IS DEAD WRONG
WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED TEN POINT SIX POINTS HIGHER AT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE POINT EIGHT
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE ELEVEN POINT SIX TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT FOUR
THE GOLD MINES INDEX FELL THREE POINT FIVE TO FOUR HUNDRED FORTY NINE POINT FIVE
VOLUME WAS LIGHT AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FRIDAY
THE CLEAREST INDICATION OF JAPAN'S BIOTECHNOLOGY AMBITIONS MAY BE THE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN THE FIELD BY THE MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY
WHEN MITI GETS INVOLVED IT'S A SAFE BET THE NATION'S SENIOR STRATEGISTS HAVE TARGETED AN INDUSTRY FOR A BIG PUSH
THOUGH MITI DOES SOME BIOTECH RESEARCH ITS MAIN ROLE IS TO SPUR AND GUIDE WORK BY OTHERS
LIKE A FISHING BOAT TOSSING CHUM IN THE WATER IT FIRST CHARTS A COURSE AND THEN PLANTS MONEY TO ATTRACT MORE
JAMES MAHONEY MR. CARSON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THE SPLIT WITH MR. BUSHKIN OCCURRED AFTER MR. CARSON DECIDED TO SELL HIS TELEVISION PRODUCTION BUSINESS
THERE AREN'T ANY FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES HE SAYS
THEY DIFFERED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS COMPANIES WERE BEING SOLD
MR. CARSON IS SAID TO HAVE DECIDED TO SELL CARSON PRODUCTIONS PIECEMEAL INSTEAD OF AS A GOING CONCERN
MR. BUSHKIN REPORTEDLY FAVORED *KEEPING* THE COMPANY WHOLE RATHER THAN AUCTIONING INDIVIDUAL ASSETS
FRESH FACES APPEAR AT THE RAINBOW KITCHEN ALMOST DAILY AMONG THEM A YOUNG COUPLE BACK FROM A DISILLUSIONING JOB HUNTING SOJOURN TO THE SUN BELT
THEY EXPECT TO BE ON THEIR FEET IN A MONTH
OTHERS SHOW UP BETWEEN ODD JOBS OR IN THE SUMMER WHEN THEIR CHILDREN CAN'T GET FREE LUNCH AT SCHOOL
HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PRONG- PROVINCE
HIS WEAPON THE PERSONAL BLESSING OF COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIA- ZIYANG
AT THE APRIL OPENING OF A FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GUANGDONG POWER PLANT OFFICIALDOM HEAPED PRAISE ON MR. WU FOR BEATING A CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE
INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
TAEKWONDO LOOKS KIND OF LIKE KARATE SO I ASKED A KOREAN OFFICIAL FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SPORTS
TAEKWONDO IS KOREAN
KARATE IS JAPANESE HE SNAPPED AND TURNED AWAY
MR. PAPAGEORGE SAID THESE WERE CONCEPTUAL NEGOTIATIONS
IDEAS WERE FLOWING
WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE
BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
WARNER LAMBERT AND SCHERING PLOUGH ARE COVETED FOR THEIR OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR PRESCRIPTION SALES
OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
<NOISE> THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
<NOISE> THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INCORPORATED SUBSIDIARY <NOISE> WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES
<NOISE> LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY
<NOISE> HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
<NOISE> MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES
AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED
HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER
<NOISE> I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN
<NOISE> BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID
INSTEAD MR. REAGAN AGREED TO LOWER THE VOLUME OF HIS COMMENTS SUPPORTING THE CONTRAS AND CRITICIZING THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED CONGRESS
HE ALSO WOULD HOLD OFF ON ANY NEW PROPOSALS FOR CONTRA MILITARY AID UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
IF THE SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND A CEASEFIRE WAS IN PLACE MR. REAGAN WOULD END HIS CONTRA MILITARY AID PROGRAM
<NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
IN A NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY NINE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING THE S. E. C.'S ENFORCEMENT DIVISION PRESSED FOR MR. KOBRIN'S PERMANENT EXPULSION FROM THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
THE DIVISION ARGUED THAT STOCK MANIPULATION OF THE KIND HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN WENT TO THE HEART OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
THE DIVISION ALSO SAID THE LAW DIRECTED THE S. E. C. TO ACT ON THE BELIEF THAT PAST MISCONDUCT RAISED A RISK OF FUTURE MISCONDUCT THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY EXPULSION
CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS
THEY SAY THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO BOOST MEMBERSHIP IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH AIRLINES CONSIDER CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING BRAND LOYALTY
THESE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS SAYS A UNITED SPOKESMAN
MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRAINING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE
WE THOUGHT THERE WAS VERY BROAD JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOND AUCTION SAID <NOISE> MR. LAKEFIELD OF SHEARSON LEHMAN
<NOISE> BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE BOUGHT FOR SHORT TERM TRADING ACCOUNTS OR FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
BUT SERVICE MERCHANDISE JUMPED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND ONE QUARTER ON ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND ONE QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER
SINCE THEN THE STOCK HAS BEEN RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMORS
WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
<NOISE> THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS
THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE PERCENT
BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES
PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS
AND WITH THE GUILD CHOOSING SUCH A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STRIKE <NOISE> T. V. PRODUCTION OFFICIALS ARE ESPECIALLY IRATE
WHEN MY FAMILY FLED WE LEFT MY NANNY IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE

F. D. A. RESEARCHERS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH YET ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF FAT SUBSTITUTES MIXING WITH MEDICATION AND OTHER SUBSTANCES
TYPICALLY LAB TESTS ON FOOD PRODUCTS ARE FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF RATS OR MICE ABOUT FOUR YEARS

AS A RECENT VISIT REVEALED THE SOUP KITCHEN HAS BECOME A POWERFUL MAGNET DRAWING HUNDREDS WHO COME FOR MORE THAN JUST DAILY NOURISHMENT
MR. KOVACS AN OCTOGENARIAN WHO CROONS LOVE BALLADS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN COMES FOR CAMARADERIE
FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE
HE ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO PICKED UP A BROOM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD STARTED CLEANING UP HE NOW GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE
THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
A SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
AND REVENUES SLUMP
THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS

MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED

PEOPLE THINK THE A. IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
IN AMSTERDAM STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN VOLATILE TRADING
SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID
<NOISE> VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION PRODUCED WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

A SERIES OF LAUNCH DISASTERS INCLUDING THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION SEVERELY CURTAILED WESTERN ACCESS TO SPACE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN
THE EUROPEAN ARIANE LAUNCHER JUST RETURNED TO COMMERCIAL SERVICE
THE U. S. SPACE PROGRAM WILL NOT ELIMINATE ITS BACKLOG OF PAYLOADS UNTIL THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES
YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD

HE'S NOT ALONE
CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
THE ONE ELEMENT OF SUSPENSE REMAINS THE SELECTION OF A RUNNING MATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
BUSH MANAGERS INSIST THEY WON'T DISCLOSE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE'S IDENTITY UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING
REAGAN ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION SITE LAST NIGHT AND PREPARED FOR HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE PARTY TONIGHT
THE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR CALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND BUSH WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CONVENTION

ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV <NOISE> WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT THE PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS
THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM

HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORP. OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED

THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
WE'VE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
BUT HE WARNS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD ASK HOW MUCH STOCK IS TOO MUCH
A DIRECTOR HOLDING A LARGE BLOCK MAY BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN SHORT TERM RESULTS THAN LONG TERM CORPORATE HEALTH
THAT DIRECTOR MAY BE MORE TEMPTED TO VOTE HIS POCKETBOOK IN A TAKEOVER FIGHT SAYS MR. WOLF
AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK
BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS *LUCRATIVE* FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA

MR. BAKER IS ALSO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH RUDOLPH GIULIANI THE U. S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN WHO IS OVERSEEING THAT OFFICE'S INVESTIGATION OF DREXEL
AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MR. BAKER OFFERED MR. GIULIANI THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE S. E. C. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MR. GIULIANI DECLINED THE POST WHICH WAS LATER ACCEPTED BY DAVID S. RUDER
ALL THE GAINS THAT WE'RE MAKING ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SAYS JAMES F. MCDONALD G. M.'S PRESIDENT
THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAPPENING IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. TODAY

IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY

I WANT TO SAY WITHOUT QUALIFICATION THAT BURGER KING IS CENTRAL TO PILLSBURY
IT WAS TRUE YESTERDAY IT IS TRUE TODAY AND IT REMAINS TRUE FOR THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC FUTURE HE SAID
SOME ISSUERS ALSO ARE WARY OF DOING AWAY WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL
IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR
ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER
MR. MORELAND COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT BUT ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING HIM HAVE PREVIOUSLY DENIED HE COMMITTED ANY ACTS OF FRAUD

THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROPS AND TO THIS YEAR'S
WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
FURTHER SIGNS OF STRONG U. S. ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FROM A LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORT NEXT FRIDAY ON THE NATION'S EMPLOYMENT PICTURE FOR AUGUST

WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES

LOS ANGELES BASED UNOCAL CORP. WITH EXTENSIVE REFINING AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES ON THE WEST COAST LONG HAS BEEN SEEN AS A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION TARGET
BUYING UNOCAL COULD ALSO GIVE B. P. A NEEDED BOOST IN ITS NATURAL GAS RESERVES

IT MADE BILLIONS ON GOLD
THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUGGESTED WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC THAT SUCH CASES MIGHT INVOLVE MISAPPROPRIATION OR ILLEGAL USE OF INFORMATION
A DECISION IN THE WINANS CASE MAY HELP DEFINE SECURITIES FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION
THESE TEENS CRAVE EXCITEMENT
THEY SPURN REST AND RECREATION
THEY DREAM ABOUT POWER AND POTS OF MONEY
ESPECIALLY MONEY
LAST MONTH PIEDMONT'S BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY ACCEPT NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY FOR SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
NORFOLK SOUTHERN HAS HAD A STAKE IN PIEDMONT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE

THE FINDING UNIFORMLY SURPRISED LONGTIME RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD
THERE IS A SPECIFIC RATIONALE BEHIND T. H. A. SAYS DOCTOR LEON THAL A RESEARCHER AT SAN DIEGO VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL

THAT TEST WAS LESS THAN A COMPLETE SUCCESS
DIRT THAT ACCUMULATED IN THE KENAF DURING HARVESTING WASN'T ALL REMOVED AND ENDED UP IN THE PAPER
THE KENAF ALSO JAMMED IN SOME EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN CUT IN LENGTHS THAT WERE SEVERAL FEET LONG

BROKERS AT MERRILL LYNCH REALTY RECALL A SALE THAT WAS DELAYED FOR A MONTH BY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIEN ON THE PROPERTY
ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED
WE WERE AT THE CLOSING TABLE WHEN THIS ALL CAME OUT SAYS WANDA HUTCHINS THE MERRILL LYNCH AGENT
INVALID FORECLOSURES ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE
THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PREMARIN BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP.'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF PREMARIN LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID PREMARIN ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
<NOISE> AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
<NOISE> HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS

THIRTEEN YEARS AGO MR. SMITH WAS MIRED IN PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS
NOW HE LIVES LIKE A SUCCESSFUL CORPORATE EXECUTIVE <NOISE>
BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
HIS IS A TAX EXEMPT NOT FOR PROFIT CORPORATION DEDICATED TO HELPING MINORS THE SICK AND THE NEEDY
IT ALSO HAS GREATLY HELPED THE SMITH FAMILY
LAST YEAR THE CORPORATION PAID THE SMITHS AND A SON IN LAW MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SALARIES AND BONUSES
MR. SMITH ALSO HAD AN OUTSTANDING UNSECURED PERSONAL LOAN OF ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ENJOYED OTHER PERQUISITES

UP AHEAD HE SPOTS A ROADBLOCK WHERE A WHITE POLICEMAN WITH A DOG IS HOLDING UP THREE BLACKS TRAVELING ON A DONKEY PULLED WAGON
MR. KGORI DECIDES TO GO STRAIGHT ON THE DIRT ROAD EVEN THOUGH IT WILL TAKE HIM AN HOUR OUT OF HIS WAY
THAT WAS ILLUSTRATED BY A TEMPORARY SURGE IN SECURITIES LENDING DURING LAST OCTOBER'S CRASH AND A PREVIOUS SECURITIES SETTLEMENTS BACKLOG IN BRITAIN
SAID ONE U. K. MONETARY OFFICIAL CLEARLY THERE WAS DEMAND IN THE MARKET FOR MORE EQUITIES MONEY BROKING
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING WITH SHEARSON'S MOVE IS A REFLECTION OF THAT DEMAND
SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS
HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK

TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION
PRICES MOVED UP IN RESPONSE TO NEWS THAT U. S. DURABLE GOODS ORDERS DECLINED SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT IN JANUARY

<NOISE> HIS PLANS INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING SOME DEBT AND SELLING ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FIVE DIVISIONS TO GENERATE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO FINANCE THE GROWTH OF THE OTHER FOUR
<NOISE> HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE DIVISION THAT WILL BE SOLD
THE LOOK AND FEEL CASES ARE GENERATING CONTROVERSY IN THE INDUSTRY
COMPANIES BRINGING THE SUITS SAY THEY ARE DEFENDING THE REWARDS DUE THOSE WHO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING CUT RATE COPIES
BUT OTHERS ARGUE THAT NEW SOFTWARE ALWAYS BORROWS FROM THE OLD
THEY SAY LOTUS IF ITS SUIT SUCCEEDS WILL STIFLE INNOVATION AND DISCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF STANDARDS THAT HELP COMPUTER USERS MASTER SOFTWARE MADE BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES

IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
POLITICAL OBSERVERS THEORIZE THAT THE POLITICAL REHABILITATION IS LINKED TO THIS INVISIBLE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
SOME SAY FOR INSTANCE THAT MR. DE LA MADRID PUT THE FORMER MINISTER ON DISPLAY TO GOAD OTHER CANDIDATES INTO WORKING HARDER
OTHERS SUGGEST THAT ONE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL IS USING THE POPULAR MR. SILVA HERZOG TO UNDERMINE HIS RIVALS
THE MOST PROVOCATIVE HYPOTHESIS HAS IT THAT MR. SILVA HERZOG HAS HIMSELF BECOME A CANDIDATE AGAIN
WE ARE AWARE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILLINGLY ACCEPT THEM THE BANKER OBSERVES
BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY

THE BUDGET HOWEVER WILL NOT MANAGE ITSELF
SOME WAY MUST BE FOUND TO PUT IT ON COURSE
IN OUR HISTORY AN IMPASSE OVER POLICY HAS BEEN BROKEN OCCASIONALLY BY SOME SORT OF NATIONAL COMMISSION AND IT IS TIME FOR ONE AGAIN
SUCH A COMMISSION RESOLVED THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROBLEM EARLIER IN THIS DECADE
IN THE JOHNSON YEARS A COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS WERE THE MEANS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE BUDGET
STILL EARLIER IT WAS A COMMISSION THAT RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
THIS APPROACH ENABLES THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO AVOID SOME FLAK BY MERELY IMPLEMENTING WHAT THE COMMISSION TOLD US TO DO
THUS THE BOARD SAID IT WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO GIVE BANK OF NEW YORK MORE THAN ONE EXTENSION OF THE INITIAL NINETY DAYS TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER
NORMALLY EXTENSIONS OF THE NINETY DAY RULE ARE GRANTED FREELY

THE PRICE INCREASES ARE EXPECTED PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AS COMMODITIES AND SERVICES ARE RISING AT ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL RATE
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND
TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST
THE CAPTAIN RAID OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS RIPPLING MUSCLES AND A FUTURISTIC LOOK

MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT AB:OUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INF:LATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
<NOISE> SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
<NOISE> IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN UP AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
<NOISE> A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
<NOISE> THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG <NOISE> THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
<NOISE> ALAS THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO WINNEBAGO'S PAST
THE COMPANY HAD A HISTORY OF CARNAGE AT THE TOP RUNNING THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT CHIEF EXECUTIVES IN THE FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE MESSRS.

IN ONE OF THOSE SHAKE UPS WINNEBAGO'S CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER JOHN K. HANSON SACKED HIS OWN SON
<NOISE> HERE ARE THE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA

THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
<NOISE> AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES

<NOISE> THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
IT IS GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
<NOISE> THE PREMIER SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR. G- GHAFAR TO REMAIN AS HIS DEPUTY
I HAVE TRUST IN HIM
I CHOSE HIM DIDN'T I
DOCTOR MAHATHIR SAID
S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE
STEVEN M. KINCAID PRESIDENT SAID KINCAID'S BOARD WOULD REVIEW THE ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN IT MEETS SOMETIME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

GEMFIBROZIL HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO INCREASE H. D. L. BUT UNTIL THIS REPORT ITS EFFECT ON HEART DISEASE WAS UNCLEAR

MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL WAS UNCHANGED AT TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTY
N. E. C. ROSE TEN PERCENT TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TEN
SONY ROSE TWENTY TO FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
<NOISE> A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
<NOISE> AND AN INTERMARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST

THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS
COMMUNIQUES ANNOUNCING COMPLETION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS WERE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NOVEMBER NINTH NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED

THE ASSOCIATION SAID FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT PREDICTED NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL BE BETTER THAN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHILE ONLY THIRTEEN PERCENT EXPECTED A WORSE YEAR
THAT IS THE HIGHEST TOTAL TO FORECAST A BETTER FUTURE YEAR IN DECEMBER SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN EIGHTY SIX PERCENT WERE EXPECTING STRONGER GROWTH
PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FOREIGN PURCHASES BEGIN THEY O- OFTEN INVOLVE THE VERY PARTS THAT MAKE WEAPONS PERFORM
FOR EXAMPLE F. M. C. CORPORATION'S BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE DEPENDS ON A SOPHISTICATED SENSOR SYSTEM FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO INFORM SOLDIERS OF POTENTIAL THREATS AND TARGETS
WITHOUT THIS PART TUCKED INTO THE TURRET OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE THE BRADLEY WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY HELPLESS ON THE BATTLEFIELD
MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT A HUNDRED MILLION IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
BUT NETWORK OFFICIALS WILL SPEND MONTHS DEBATING C. B. S.'S WISDOM
IT'S TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE SAID MR. WILSON TESTILY TAKING ON REPORTERS AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE
I'M UP HERE STATING C. B. S. HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS AND N. B. C. HASN'T

IN ANOTHER TRADE DISPUTE KANSAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CORPORATION HAS COME UNDER ATTACK
JAPAN INSISTS THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF A NEW AIRPORT AT OSAKA IS PRIVATE AND NOT SUBJECT TO MINISTRY ORDERS
FOREIGNERS SAY THAT IS A SEMANTIC ARGUMENT BECAUSE NEARLY FOUR FIFTHS OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVES HAIL FROM GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES
THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE MOSLEM LEAGUE CAME INTO THE SHARED POWER ARRANGEMENT MR. IJAZ ALI GOT INTO THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
THERE HE WRUNG THOUSANDS OF RUPEES FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD ROADS SCHOOLS AND ELECTRIFICATION SYSTEMS IN HIS DISTRICT

U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR
IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
AND DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES LEBANESE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGEN(CE)- AGENCY'S TOP MIDDLE EAST OPERATIVES ROBERT AMES AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY
AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM
MOREOVER ANY TAX REFORM MUST CLEAR PARLIAMENT'S UPPER HOUSE THE BUNDESRAT WHERE THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION CLINGS TO A MAJORITY
SOME BANKS HAVE ALREADY RE- TURNED CERTAIN DEBTS INTO SECURITIES WHICH SO FAR THEY HAVE HELD RATHER THAN SELLING

THE PHILIP MORRIS MAGAZINE ENJOYS BY FAR THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION OF ANY COMPANY MAGAZINE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION COPIES

SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A UNITED NATIONS SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE

<NOISE> <NOISE> WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE EXPLAINS THE PROBLEMS AS THE OPPOSITE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
LAST YEAR YOU HAD TUMULTUOUS SWINGS IN THE MARKETS THEMSELVES HE SAYS
THIS YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE NARROWER SWINGS BUT VOLUME WILL BE LOWER WITH REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS
<NOISE> MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
<NOISE> MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
<NOISE> <NOISE> THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS <NOISE> THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
CLASS A. STOCK HAS ONE TWENTIETH OF A VOTE PER SHARE AND WILL RECEIVE AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF TEN CENTS A SHARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY
CLASS B. STOCK HAS ONE VOTE PER SHARE BUT PRESIDIO HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THESE SHARES
PRESIDIO HOLDERS MAY EXCHANGE THEIR CLASS B. SHARES ON A SHARE FOR SHARE BASIS THROUGH JUNE THIRTY
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED

THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHREYER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
<NOISE> <NOISE> STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING REGULATORS WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
WITH THE INITIAL FINANCING COMPLETE L. S. I. LOOKED ABROAD IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR ITS NEXT INFUSION
WE DECIDED TO GO TO INVESTORS WHO'D PAY A HIGHER PRICE EXPLAINS MR. CORRIGAN
AT THE TIME EUROPEANS WERE CLAMORING TO INVEST IN U. S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN GOOD DEALS HE SAYS
<NOISE> IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN ONE THREE THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
TORONTO BASED P. C. L. MAKES PACKAGING AND FURNITURE
ROBERT J. TWEEDY ITS PRESIDENT SAID THE COMPANY IS LOOKING AT OPTIONS BUT HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER
MR. TWEEDY AND THOMAS N. DAVIDSON CHAIRMAN OWN NINETEEN PERCENT OF P. C. L.'S FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
<NOISE> <NOISE> MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS <NOISE> WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
<NOISE> IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
<NOISE> THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED AT A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFITS FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
<NOISE> CRITICS AGREE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM *VICE* PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR MORE MISSILE PLANS
THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION TO- UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS

PRODUCTION IS TO START IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX
MR. TAYLOR WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT A POST HE HAS HELD SINCE MAY FIRST
HE ALSO HAS SERVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER THAT POSITION WILL BE ELIMINATED NEXT TUESDAY

A MAJOR CONCERN IS A DROP IN REAL ESTATE VALUES WHEN EXTENSIVE LANDHOLDINGS OF FAILED BANKS ARE SOLD
ONE POSSIBLE GOAL A REGIONAL CONSORTIUM TO HELP PROP UP LAND PRICES
VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY IN THE BUSINESS COMPLAINS ABOUT TOO MANY AWARDS AND MOST BIG AGENCIES TRY TO ENTER ONLY THE FIVE OR TEN MOST PRESTIGIOUS CONTESTS
YET EVEN THE MOST VEHEMENT CRITICS KEEP ON COMPETING
IF YOU DON'T IT LOOKS LIKE YOU AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN COMPLAINS ROY GRACE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW YORK AGENCY GRACE AND ROTHSCHILD
YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME
CLEVELAND CONFRONTED SCANDALS SWIFTLY AND WITH UNCOMMON CANDOR CONCEDING FROM THE OUTSET FOR EXAMPLE HIS AFFAIR WITH MARIA HALPIN ONCE IT WAS EXPOSED
YET HE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO CONCEAL HIS CANCER SURGERY
MR. REAGAN ON THE OTHER HAND EXPOSED HIS MALIGNANT BOWELS TO THE NATION BUT ONLY GRUDGINGLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IRAN CONTRA FIASCO
MEANWHILE THE AGENCY SAID IT WILL CONDUCT A STUDY ON ITS OWN
OFFICIALS SAID THE REVIEW MAY LEAD TO NEW REGULATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS
THE AGENCY MAY ALSO CHALLENGE PAST CHARGES TO THE PENTAGON
PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE REVIEW LIKELY WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR
WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST
WE CAN'T ARGUE THAT STRONGLY FOR SPENDING BILLIONS ABROAD TO BUY DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES SAYS A VENEZUELAN OIL OFFICIAL
OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
AND THAT FIGURE DOESN'T INCLUDE GAMBLING REVENUE
CASINOS ARE FLUSH WITH HIGH ROLLERS WHEN A BIG FIGHT COMES TO TOWN ENABLING THEM TO RAISE MINIMUM TABLE BETS SKY HIGH
IN ATLANTIC CITY IT TOOK ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ELBOW INTO A TRUMP PLAZA CRAPS GAME THE NIGHT OF THE MICHAEL SPINKS GERRY COONEY HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT IN JUNE
MANY BLACKJACK TABLES HAD A MINIMUM BET OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
THE RESULT THE AMOUNTS WAGERED THAT MONDAY NIGHT EXCEEDED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS UP FROM ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR AN AVERAGE MONDAY
THE SURVEY'S COMPOSITE INDEX FELL TO FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT IN NOVEMBER FROM OCTOBER'S SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT
A FIGURE ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS GENERALLY EXPANDING
NOVEMBER MARKS THE SIXTEENTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF EXPANSION
TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH LOW
LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH STAGFLATION
BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY
I THINK MR.
TSAI IS PROBABLY TORN BETWEEN TWO GOALS BUILDING A WORLD CLASS FINANCIAL COMPANY AND MAKING MONEY PERSONALLY SAYS MARTIN SOSNOFF OF ATALANTA SOSNOFF CAPITAL
WHILE THE GOALS AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE HE ADDS THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ATTAINABLE AT THE SAME TIME

<NOISE> SIR GEOFFREY HOWE SAID A TERRORIST ACT HAS BEEN AVERTED
THE THREE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN REPORTEDLY WERE PLANNING A BOMB ATTACK ON A MILITARY PARADE TODAY IN THE BRITISH COLONY
THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE
NOW THE JURY CAN CONSIDER ALMOST ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT CAME IN ABOUT DEFENDANTS' ATTEMPTS TO STONEWALL AND DENY
THE FLIPPERS APPARENTLY WAITED THE TWO WEEKS THEN DUMPED THEIR SHARES WHEN TRADING OPENED IN THE STOCK
THE FLIPPERS IN THE INDUSTRY WERE HUNGRIER TO DO THIS THAN EXPECTED AN EXECUTIVE CLOSE TO THE DEAL SAYS
THEY WERE ABLE TO BORROW MONEY
ANALYSTS SAY THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE THAT KAO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLIER U. S. ACQUISITION
LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORPORATION FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
HIGH POINT PRODUCES RAW MATERIALS FOR TOILETRY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT EITHER WILLFULLY OR OTHERWISE TO EVADE INCOME TAX MR. SEOW SAID
MR. SEOW SAID IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY THAT IF CONVICTED HE COULD FACE A PRISON SENTENCE
HE REPEATED HIS VOW TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR
WHY NOT FARMERS RESPOND
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THESE PRICES BEFORE SAYS DAVID GUSTAFSON AN EATON COLORADO BEAN GROWER
HE STILL HAS HALF OF LAST YEAR'S HARVEST IN STORAGE EVEN THOUGH HE WILL START HARVESTING THIS YEAR'S CROP THIS WEEK
I WANTED TO SPECULATE HE EXPLAINS
WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREED ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
WITHIN THE RULING COALITION THE LIBERAL FREE DEMOCRATS AND THE BAVARIAN SISTER PARTY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS WANT CUTS SPREAD ACROSS THE BOARD
MR. FUNARO DESCRIBED AS HOT AIR AND NONSENSE FOREIGN BANKERS' LANGUAGE IN THEIR CRITICISM OF BRAZIL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC POLICY
HE SAID NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT BRAZIL'S HIGH INFLATION WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING BIG SURPLUSES TO MEET DEBT PAYMENTS
<NOISE> INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR EXCUSES HE SAID THESE BANKS SHOULD REALIZE THERE'S A DEBT CRISIS AND IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY BOTH SIDES
KIDDER PEABODY WAS FINED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BY THE S. E. C. TO SETTLE INSIDER TRADING AND OTHER CHARGES
THE PENALTY IS SECOND ONLY TO IVAN BOESKY'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FINE LAST FALL
KIDDER'S SETTLEMENT THE FIRST BY A MAJOR FIRM IN THE INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL WILL ALLOW THE G. E. SUBSIDIARY TO ESCAPE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION
EVEN SO GLORIA HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP HOPE
I HEAR THAT ONLY PEOPLE WITH MONEY WILL BE APPROVED SHE SAYS
MY MOTHER TELLS HER IT ISN'T TRUE TO BE PATIENT
THE FIRM DOLLAR ALSO BOOSTED PRICES IN ZURICH AND ENCOURAGED SELECTIVE BUYING BY FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTORS DEALERS SAID
SOME FINANCIAL CHEMICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL STOCKS HAD THE BIGGEST GAINS
BANKS ALSO ENDED MOSTLY HIGHER
MEANWHILE MR. SILVA HERZOG BORROWED A FRIEND'S UNMARKED OFFICE IN CENTRAL MEXICO CITY AND DISCREETLY RECEIVED VISITORS
HE TURNED DOWN JOB OFFERS FROM COMPANIES AND INTERNATIONAL LENDING AGENCIES BUT ACCEPTED LECTURING ENGAGEMENTS ABROAD
HE THOUGHT ABOUT OPENING A U. S. LATIN AMERICA STUDIES CENTER IN MEXICO CITY OR SETTING UP A CONSULTING FIRM
WHAT HAPPENS NOW
THAT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS WHETHER MANAGEMENT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE WORKERS AND WHETHER UNION LEADERS CAN CONTROL THE RANK AND FILE
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON EITHER COUNT
INDEED LABOR EXPERTS SAY THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE THAT SOUTH KOREA CAN LAY A FOUNDATION FOR LABOR RELATIONS THAT MIGHT CALM WORKER UNREST SOON
TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS <NOISE>
BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE
IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION
WE SEEM TO BE READY TO TAKE A LITTLE REST SAID ONE PARTICIPANT
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE EITHER SCREAMINGLY WORRIED OR SCREAMINGLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS MARKET SAID ANOTHER
I THINK THE ATTITUDE HAS GOT TO BE THAT WE'VE BEEN OUTPERFORMING THE OTHER WORLD MARKETS AND NOW THE OTHER MARKETS MAY BE OUTPERFORMING THIS ONE A LITTLE
JULY PLATINUM ROSE TEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS AN OUNCE TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS
JULY SILVER ADVANCED EIGHT POINT FIVE CENTS AN OUNCE TO SEVEN DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN POINT FIVE CENTS
AUGUST GOLD GAINED ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY CENTS AN OUNCE TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS
ALL THREE METALS TRADED HIGHER AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE DAY BUT LATE PROFIT TAKING TRIMMED THE ADVANCES
BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
<NOISE> LAWRENCE SUMMERS ECONOMIC ADVISER TO GOVERNOR DUKAKIS URGES THAT EVEN THE BEST FIGURES PROVIDE A DISCOURAGING PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY
IT USED TO BE THAT STANDARDS OF LIVING ROSE RELIABLY HE SAYS REFERRING TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES <NOISE>
BUT THE PACE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAS BEEN NEGATIVE BY MY PREFERRED MEASURE AND GLACIAL BY ANY OTHER
STILL THE NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTS A REMARKABLE CONCEPTUAL LEAP IN THE COMPUTER WORLD
IT IS A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCK IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUCH AS THE NEURONS IN HUMANS ARE THE VEHICLE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION
THE NETWORK HAS ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO CREATE THE FIRST CONVINCING LIKENESS OF THE BRAIN IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY AND VISION
DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
BUT THIS IS A VERY LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET
THE KREMLIN WHICH LONG DENIED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL PRISONERS HERE NOW CONCEDES THEY DO EXIST
THE MOST RECENT OFFICIAL SOVIET ESTIMATES PUT THE TOTAL BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY NINE
MOSCOW DEFINES POLITICAL PRISONERS AS PEOPLE SENTENCED UNDER TWO ARTICLES OF THE SOVIET CRIMINAL CODE THAT MAKE BEHAVIOR LOOSELY DEFINED AS ANTI SOVIET A CRIMINAL OFFENSE
BOTH ARTICLES OF THE CODE WERE WIDELY USED IN LOCKING UP DISSIDENTS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
<NOISE> AD AGENCIES IN THE PAST HAVE TYPICALLY RECEIVED AS COMMISSIONS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF AN ADVERTISER'S BILLINGS THE TOTAL COST OF PLACING ADS
THE PURCHASED UNITS HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BILLINGS OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
AYER HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BILLINGS OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
CRAY ALREADY HAS SOLD TWO OF THE NEW COMPUTERS
<NOISE> ALL TOLD CRAY SAYS IT EXPECTS TO SELL FOUR Y. M. P.S THIS YEAR AND PERHAPS A DOZEN NEXT YEAR ABOUT AS MANY AS IT CAN BUILD

IN ITS OFFER BATUS SIGNALED THAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS MAY TAKE MONTHS
IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS <NOISE>
IF THE EXTRADITION EFFORT FAILS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT LOSES MORE THAN THE CHANCE TO PROSECUTE A KEY SUSPECT
IT ALSO COULD LOSE ACCESS TO AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST OTHER ACCUSED INDIVIDUALS
FIVE OTHER PROMINENT BRITISH BUSINESSMEN INCLUDING FORMER GUINNESS CHAIRMAN ERNEST SAUNDERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION
THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AUDIENCE OF MOSTLY ADULTS WATCHING DOMINICK AND EUGENE WAS REMARKABLY QUIET UNTIL ONE OF THE CHARACTERS ON SCREEN PICKED UP A GUN
OH NO A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THEATER GASPED BREAKING THE SILENCE
A FEW PEOPLE GIGGLED NERVOUSLY YOU COULD TELL THEY'D BEEN THINKING THE SAME THING THEMSELVES
THEN MORE SILENCE INTERRUPTED AGAIN LATER BY A ROUND OF COMMUNAL SOBBING
IN AN AWKWARD REMINDER OF THE BOOM DAYS SHEARSON'S NEW LONDON HEADQUARTERS FACES AN ICE SKATING RINK BUILT JUST TO GIVE THE COMPLEX MORE GRANDEUR
OUTDOOR ORGAN MUSIC BLARES LAWRENCE WELK TUNES ONE DAY AS TWO BOYS SKATE ALONE ON THE ICE WITH HOCKEY STICKS
IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT A SHEARSON OFFICIAL BITTERLY REMARKS
UNDERNEATH THE SKATING RINK IS A GYMNASIUM SHEARSON IS TRYING TO SELL
FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES RETREATED ACROSS THE BOARD IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING AS THE DAY EARLIER DECLINE ON WALL STREET AND WEAKER DOLLAR PROMPTED WIDESPREAD PROFIT TAKING
BUT EQUITIES RECOVERED SOME OF THEIR EARLIER LOSSES LATE IN THE SESSION AND MOST PRICES CLOSED ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER
THE MARKET'S BULLISH MOMENTUM IS STILL INTACT TRADERS SAID CITING A FLURRY OF LATE BUY ORDERS
AFTER YESTERDAY'S VOTE MR. MULRONEY WOULDN'T SAY WHETHER HE WOULD TAKE ANY ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER EIGHT TORIES WHO VOTED AGAINST THE BILL
SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL HE SAID IT'S A FACT OF LIFE
YOU TRY AND GET UNANIMITY BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED
STATE PRE EMPTION WAS PROTESTED BY LESLIE GAINER A LOBBYIST FOR THE U. S. PUBLIC INTEREST GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS CONSUMERS
IT'S A REAL SLAP IN THE FACE OF STATE LEGISLATORS SHE SAID
SHE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT FULL DISCLOSURE ISN'T IMMEDIATELY REQUIRED IN CREDIT CARD SOLICITATIONS ON THE TELEPHONE OR IN MAGAZINES CATALOGS AND FLYERS
YET SHE PRAISED THE BILL FOR ENHANCING THE DISCLOSURE MADE IN MOST STATES
STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION PUT THIS PERSONNEL SERVICES CONCERN'S SEVENTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF B. PLUS RATED CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBT ON CREDITWATCH WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS
THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE DISCLOSURE LAST WEEK THAT INVESTMENT BANKER GIBBONS GREEN VAN AMERONGEN LIMITED PLANS A TWO STEP ACQUISITION OF A SUBSTANTIAL STAKE IN ROBERT HALF
A ROBERT HALF OFFICIAL SAID THE COMPANY IS CONVINCED THAT OUR DEBT COVERAGE WILL BE STRONG AND WE DON'T THINK THE RISKS WILL BE UNREASONABLE
MR. GREENSPAN COMPLIED
WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I GATHER IS HAPPENING HERE HE SAID
JUST WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE DAM BROKE WHICH LED US TO A RATHER SURPRISING END
AN UPJOHN SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY PLANNED TO MARKET ROGAINE TO WOMEN ALL ALONG
HOWEVER F. D. A. APPROVAL FOR USING THE DRUG ON MEN CAME FIRST BECAUSE UPJOHN DIDN'T TEST THE PRODUCT ON ENOUGH WOMEN INITIALLY
UPJOHN SAID IT BEGAN TESTING ROGAINE ON WOMEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ABOUT FOUR YEARS AFTER TESTS ON BALDING MEN BEGAN
BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SM:ALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
THE DOLLAR'S SLIPPAGE CAME DESPITE MORE COMMENTS FROM TREASURY SECRETARY JAMES BAKER AIMED AT SUPPORTING IT
IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW MR. BAKER SAID THE U. S. AND ITS TOP SIX ECONOMIC ALLIES ARE PREPARED TO ACT TO STABILIZE THE DOLLAR AROUND THE CURRENT LEVELS
LAST WEEK THE TREASURY SECRETARY WARNED IN A SPEECH THAT A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE U. S. CURRENCY'S VALUE COULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS

ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WILL BE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE AT ROCKWELL'S DOWNEY CALIFORNIA FACILITY
<NOISE> ONLY FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS IN TOTAL WILL BE CREATED
EDWARD KENNEDY A ROCKWELL SPOKESMAN SAID MANY OF THOSE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE IN PALMDALE WILL BE THOSE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING B. ONE B. AIRCRAFT
A DIGITAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE COURT ACTION DOESN'T CHANGE THE <NOISE> STATUS QUO
<NOISE> THE PART OF THE RULING THAT WAS OVERTURNED HASN'T BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE LAST JANUARY WHEN EMULEX OBTAINED THE STAY HE SAID
<NOISE> HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
MR. PRENDERGAST ALSO ADMIRES NOMURA'S PERSEVERANCE

THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THE WEALTH OF JAPAN AND THE FLOWS OF CAPITAL FROM JAPAN HAVE PAID OFF FOR THEM
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D SIT BACK AND JUST ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS SAID EDWARD P. NICOSKI MARKET STRATEGIST AT PIPER JAFFRAY AND HOPWOOD INC. MINNEAPOLIS

THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTH ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM

STAMFORD CONNECTICUT BASED CHAMPION HAS FOURTEEN SUCH PLANTS NATIONWIDE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
THE INTERNATIONAL WOODWORKERS OF AMERICA AND THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS UNION STRUCK TWO CHAMPION MILLS WHERE THE CONTRACT RECENTLY EXPIRED ACCORDING TO A CHAMPION SPOKESMAN

THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE AGREES ARTHUR CHRISTY THE FIRST SPECIAL PROSECUTOR APPOINTED UNDER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LAW
IN PAST INVESTIGATIONS HE NOTES THE FOCUS HAS BEEN QUITE NARROW
BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
THE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
SOME TIRE EXECUTIVES SUCH AS JOHN J. NEVIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FIRESTONE TIRE AND RUBBER COMPANY SAY MR. STONE UNDERSTANDS THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS
BUT MR. STONE'S UNION CRITICS AREN'T SO GENEROUS
THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN LAX ABOUT ORGANIZING NEW MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE
UNDER THE AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL YPSILANTI SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE ONE POINT NINE THREE FIVE SHARES OF TRUSTCORP COMMON FOR EACH COMMON SHARE OF YPSILANTI
TRUSTCORP SAID IT PLANS TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
YPSILANTI SAVINGS BANK HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION IN ASSETS
TRUSTCORP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH ASSETS OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION
CRITICS OF INDEXING CHARGE THAT THE APPROACH LACKS IMAGINATION AND AMOUNTS TO SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY
<NOISE> ADVOCATES REPLY THAT INDEXING MEANS LOWER MANAGEMENT FEES THAN THOSE OF ACTIVELY MANAGED BOND FUNDS
ALSO INDEXING IN RECENT YEARS OFTEN HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RESULTS THAN MANY ACTIVE MANAGERS
BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
<NOISE> HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
<NOISE> WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
<NOISE> WHEN STOCKS ARE RISING PORTFOLIO INSURERS DON'T HEDGE AND INSTEAD RIDE THE MARKET HIGHER
WHEN STOCKS ARE FALLING PORTFOLIO INSURERS SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES IN EFFECT CUSHIONING THE VALUES OF THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS FROM THE FULL BRUNT OF A DROPPING MARKET
THE IDEA ACCORDING TO WALL STREET PROPONENTS IS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AT A LOW COST
AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
DECEMBER DELIVERY GOLD SETTLED AT FOUR EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY FOR A DECLINE OF TWELVE EIGHTY
DECEMBER SILVER FELL THIRTY THREE POINT THREE CENTS TO SIX POINT SIX FOUR FIVE
JANUARY PLATINUM WAS DOWN THIRTEEN SIXTY TO FOUR NINETY FORTY

THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
CAR SALES APPARENTLY HAVE LEVELED OFF AFTER DISAPPOINTING RESULTS EARLY IN THE YEAR FOLLOWED BY A SHARP UPTICK IN LATE JANUARY
BIGGER INCENTIVES FUELED THE REBOUND AND HAVE HELPED SUSTAIN THE SALES PACE
CHRYSLER CORP. FOR EXAMPLE BOOSTED CASH REBATES TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON SOME MODELS
GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
<NOISE> BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
GENERALLY THERE'S NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCH OF THEIR FUNDS EMPLOYEES CAN BORROW IF THEIR ACCOUNTS TOTAL TEN THOUSAND OR LESS
FOR LARGER ACCOUNTS EMPLOYEES ARE RESTRICTED TO BORROWING HALF THE TOTAL BUT NO MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND
<NOISE> LOANS MUST BE REPAID WITHIN FIVE YEARS UNLESS THE MONEY GOES TOWARD BUYING A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IN WHICH CASE LONGER REPAYMENT TERMS CAN BE ARRANGED
BORROWED FUNDS AREN'T TAXED
BUT A WITHDRAWAL IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME AND IS SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT PENALTY TAX
LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL
<NOISE> A SUBPOENA IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING
MR. ICAHN'S LAWYERS AT WEIL GOTSCHAL AND MANGES IN NEW YORK SAID THE INVESTIGATION HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF MR. ICAHN'S BID
BUT MR. GIBBS IS HOPEFUL THAT MANY TAXPAYERS WILL ACCEPT
AMONG OTHER INCENTIVES THE NEW TAX LAW PHASES OUT THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE I. R. S.
<NOISE> THE I. R. S. ALSO HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAX COURT CHALLENGES TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN TAX SHELTERS
WE'RE WINNING MORE THAN WE'RE LOSING THE I. R. S. CHIEF POINTS OUT
DOUBLEDAY ALSO PROVIDED BERTELSMANN WITH MUCH NEEDED U. S. BOOK MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER CLAIM THAT IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS NOT THE DOGS THEMSELVES ARE TO BLAME FOR THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATTACKS
THEY'RE AMORAL SAYS AN OFFICIAL OF THE UNITED KENNEL CLUB A PRESTIGIOUS PEDIGREE ASSOCIATION
THEY'LL DO WHAT THE TRAINER ALLOWS THEM TO DO
K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS
THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE !TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID
THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE
CURRENT HEMDALE HOLDERS THEN WOULD HAVE OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COMPUTER MEMORIES' SHARES
THE SURVIVING COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED HEMDALE FILM CORP. AND JOHN DALY HEMDALE'S CURRENT CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY
A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
<NOISE> ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
<NOISE> THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS THE COMPANY THAT INVENTED THE OVERNIGHT EXPRESS BUSINESS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO STILL DOMINATES IT
<NOISE> FEDERAL EXPRESS COLLECTS MORE THAN HALF THE REVENUE IN WHAT IS NOW MORE THAN A SIX BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
<NOISE> AND AT A TIME WHEN DETERIORATING SERVICE IS A NATIONAL MALADY THIS COMPANY CLAIMS TO DELIVER MORE THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ITS LETTERS AND PACKAGES ON TIME
HOUSING STARTS TOTALED ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UNITS LAST YEAR UP TWENTY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN DECEMBER ALONE STARTS ROSE TWENTY POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE UNITS
THAT MARKED THE TWENTIETH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASE
EARLY FEBRUARY NORTH AMERICAN BUILT CAR SALES EDGED UP ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ACCORDING TO FIGURES REPORTED LAST WEEK
THAT TRANSLATES INTO A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATE OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION VEHICLES COMPARED WITH A SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION RATE A YEAR EARLIER
THIS WEEK'S MID FEBRUARY REPORT ON CAR SALES WILL TELL WHETHER THAT PACE WAS BEING MAINTAINED
OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER
<NOISE> AS PORTFOLIO STRATEGISTS PUZZLE OVER THE MARKET IMPACT OF THIS WAVE OF GOOD NEWS THEY COME UP WITH SOME SHARPLY DIVERGENT OPINIONS
AFTER LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN
<NOISE> BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND
I READ HIS BOOK
MONARCH CAPITAL ROSE TWO TO FORTY ONE AND THREE QUARTERS
THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING ONE MILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES SAID IT WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE MILLION SHARES
MONARCH HAS ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE THIRD SECTION DISPLAYS THE DAY'S TOP NEWS FROM EQUITY CREDIT AND OTHER MARKETS IN THE U. S. AND ABROAD
YOUR MONEY MATTERS HAS BEEN MOVED TO THIS PAGE
<NOISE> ALSO APPEARING THERE ARE MARKETS DIARY AND INVESTMENT INSIGHTS TWO GRAPHIC SUMMARIES OF MARKET TRENDS
THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE DIRECTED THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT A TASK FORCE ON PROJECT ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
CONGRESS CHARGED THE GROUP WITH DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR THE EXPANDED USE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AS A MEANS OF BROADENING THE CAPITAL OWNERSHIP BASE THERE
MR. REAGAN NAMED SENIOR DIPLOMAT AND FINANCIER J. WILLIAM MIDDENDORF THE SECOND THE FORMER U. S. AMBASSADOR TO THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AS CHAIRMAN
THE SYSTEM ISN'T HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD

THE FIRM'S CO CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAID IT IS MEETING ALL OF ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
SALOMON INCORPORATED ROSE THREE TO TWENTY FIVE E. F. HUTTON GAINED ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PAINEWEBBER ADDED ONE TO EIGHTEEN AND A QUARTER
<NOISE> THE BILL IF IT BECOMES LAW WOULD BAR HOSTILE ACQUIRERS FROM MERGING WITH THEIR TARGETS FOR THREE YEARS AFTER AN OFFER IS LAUNCHED EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
THE DELAWARE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE LEGISLATION TUESDAY
THE SENATE IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE IT TODAY
ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN INTERNATIONAL STOCK PICKERS JOHN TEMPLETON NEARLY EQUALED THE INDEX WITHOUT ANY JAPANESE STOCKS IN HIS SMALL TEMPLETON FOREIGN FUND
HE DID SO VIA WINNING BETS IN SUCH MARKETS AS MEXICO CANADA AND BRITAIN
WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE HE SAID
HIS LARGER FUNDS WHICH CAN INCLUDE U. S. STOCKS DIDN'T FARE AS WELL
TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE <NOISE>
<NOISE> THE NETWORKS HAVE BEGUN THE DELICATE CRAFT OF SPINNING THE NUMBERS TO THEIR BENEFIT AND OF PUTTING THE BEST SHINE ON A DISMAL TELEVISION SEASON
<NOISE> C. B. S. HELD A NEWS BRIEFING LAST FRIDAY
A. B. C. HOSTS ONE TODAY N. B. C. WILL DO SO TOMORROW
SOME RULES GOVERNING THE ABILITY TO STAY IN BUSINESS TAKE EFFECT FRIDAY
BUT PROFESSOR PENNINGTON SAYS IT WILL BE TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE BUSINESSES BEGIN TO LOSE THEIR AUTHORIZATION
REGULATORS HE SAYS CAN'T BE TOO HARD ON PEOPLE WHO JUSTIFIABLY CLAIM THEY HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO COMPLY
<NOISE> ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED HE SAYS
WE HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS THAN WE DID BEFORE
HE'S PLANNING ON SPENDING SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION THIS YEAR COMPARED WITH A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST
CONDOM SALES FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED IN APRIL
CARTER WALLACE'S SHARE AMOUNTS TO OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET
MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE *THAI* CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
AS A RESULT THE SEQUOIA WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE U. S. NAVY THIS YEAR
OR PERHAPS ANY YEAR
AND THE SHIP WHICH WAS USED BY EIGHT U. S. PRESIDENTS MIGHT EVEN GO UNDER
THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
<NOISE> IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
IN RECENT MONTHS SPICER HAS CUT ITS ONE THOUSAND MEMBER U. S. STAFF BY TEN PERCENT IN AN EFFORT TO CUT COSTS
MR. BERNSTEIN SAID THAT A MERGER OF THE TWO FIRMS WORLD WIDE WOULD CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION WITH ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE
WE BELIEVE SPICER IS A VERY GOOD NICHE FIRM BUT OUR MERGER DISCUSSIONS ARE VERY EARLY AT THIS POINT HE SAID
<NOISE> IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
IT'S ABOUT AS INTERESTING AS YESTERDAY'S TUNA FISH SAID MARYANN KELLER AN AUTO ANALYST WITH FURMAN SELZ MAGER DIETZ AND BIRNEY
THE JAPANESE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HECK OF A TIME SELLING TWO POINT THREE MILLION CARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
I'M NOT SURE HOLDING QUOTAS DOES THEM ANY HARM
MS. BASS WON'T DISCUSS STRATEGY FOR I. MAGNIN
BUT INDUSTRY OBSERVERS SAY I. MAGNIN LIKE OTHER RETAILERS IN TODAY'S SATURATED MARKETS WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A MORE FOCUSED IDENTITY
MS. BASS ALSO WILL HAVE TO REASSESS THE VALUE OF SOME OF ITS SCATTERED STORES INCLUDING THOSE IN CHICAGO WASHINGTON AND ARIZONA AND INCREASE SALES VOLUME
THAT'S THE ONLY CURE SAYS MARK SHULMAN PRESIDENT OF LIMITED INCORPORATED'S HENRI BENDEL AND A FORMER EXECUTIVE AT I. MAGNIN AND BLOOMINGDALE'S
WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREED ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
WITHIN THE RULING COALITION THE LIBERAL FREE DEMOCRATS AND THE BAVARIAN SISTER PARTY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS WANT CUTS SPREAD ACROSS THE BOARD
HIS ANSWER RAISE THE TEMPERATURE ARTIFICIALLY IN THE MORNING BY JOGGING OR WITH A HOT DRINK
BREAKFAST ALSO HELPS AS DOES JUMPING INTO A HOT SHOWER ON AWAKENING
AT THE OPPOSITE END MORNING PEOPLE TAKE NAPS
A FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTE NAP AT TWO OR THREE P. M. <NOISE> WILL GIVE THEM MORE ENERGY
MR. WALSH'S LEGAL THEORY ABOUT THE FLOW OF FUNDS IS LIKELY TO BE THE LINCHPIN OF AN EFFORT TO BRING BROADER CONSPIRACY AND OTHER CRIMINAL CHARGES
CENTRAL TARGETS OF THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN POINDEXTER FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE OLIVER NORTH AND RETIRED AIR FORCE MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD SECORD
A FINAL DECISION ON SEEKING CHARGES COULD COME IN SEPTEMBER
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
REMEMBER THE ONE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BANKER
IT WAS WIDELY TOLD CIRCA OCTOBER NINETEENTH *NINETEEN* EIGHTY SEVEN AND WENT LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU CALL AN INVESTMENT BANKER
HEY WAITER
HARDLINERS FOR INSTANCE WANT A LAW THAT BANS ALL OBSCENE AND INDECENT SPEECH OVER THE TELEPHONE
THE BATTLE SHOULD BE CARRIED TO THE SUPREME COURT ARGUES REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM DANNEMEYER A CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN
DIAL A PORN HE SAYS MOVES SEXUALITY FROM THE HUMAN LEVEL TO THE ANIMAL LEVEL
THESE ARE VERY INTERESTING TIMES SAID RICHARD SHAFFER AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT AND ANALYST WHO PUBLISHES TECHNOLOGIC COMPUTER LETTER
A YEAR AGO IT SEEMED THAT I. B. M. AND MICROSOFT ALONE WOULD DICTATE THE STANDARDS FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS IN THE OFFICE
NOW AFTER APPLE'S LAWSUIT CHALLENGING MICROSOFT AND SUN COMING UP WITH OPEN LOOK FOR UNIX WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING THREE VERY COMPETITIVE STANDARDS
THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES MAGAZINES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN OFF LIMITS TO ALL ADVERTISERS
BUT RECENTLY THE ARMY AND NAVY STARTED CONSIDERING FARMING THEIRS OUT TO COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS WHO WOULD ACCEPT ADS
<NOISE> WE'RE EXPLORING IT TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY WE COULD SAVE ON OUR SOLDIERS MAGAZINE AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAYS
ALL OF THIS REFLECTS A MOVE OF TRANSITION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT HAS GRIPPED BRITAIN'S PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED THEATER IN RECENT YEARS
FRETTING ABOUT FINANCES MOST COMPANIES ARE TAKING FEWER CREATIVE RISKS
AUDIENCES IN TURN HAVE GROWN MORE CONSERVATIVE
YET THERE'S MORE WORK PERFORMED NOW THAN IN YEARS MAINLY TO KEEP REVENUES FLOWING
THE TIGERS DON'T LIKE TO STRESS THE SOURCE OF THEIR BASEBALL PROWESS
THE TEAM'S PRESS RELEASES SAYS THE TEAM HAS ENGLISH BORN AND BRED PLAYERS
UNDER QUESTIONING IN THE STADIUM PUB MR. HUNT ADMITS TO HAVING RECRUITED A DUTCHMAN A PAKISTANI AND AN AMERICAN THIRD BASEMAN
THE SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE FOR CINDERELLA IS TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS AND FOR E. T. TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS
<NOISE> BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DISCOUNTED BY AS MUCH AS NINE DOLLARS A CASSETTE AND BOTH HAVE REBATE OFFERS
THE HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY IS HOPING THE MASSIVE PURCHASES OF BOTH CASSETTES WILL TURN MANY CASSETTE RENTERS INTO AT LEAST OCCASIONAL BUYERS IN THE FUTURE
THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR
BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES
THE GROUPS ALSO CRITICIZE THE LACK OF A BLANKET SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS
BUT MANY OTHER BUSINESS OBJECTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE SENATE NEGOTIATIONS PRETTY MUCH ELIMINATING THE CHANCES THAT THE MEASURE COULD YET BE DERAILED
<NOISE> NOW HE SELLS KNOCKOFF GUCCI AND ROLEX WATCHES STARTING AT FIFTY DOLLARS APIECE TO THE SECRETARIES AT HIS PREP SCHOOL
<NOISE> MY STRATEGY IS TO GET THEM ALONE HE EXPLAINS
THEN LATER THEY CAN SHOW OFF THEIR WATCHES AND BRAG ABOUT THEIR GENEROUS HUSBANDS <NOISE>
ROBERT E. WUNDERLE VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOR SUPERMARKETS GENERAL SAID THE COMPANY HAS HELD DISCUSSIONS IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE HAFTS
HE ADDED THAT THE COMPANY IS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE HAFTS HAVE CHOSEN TO PUBLICIZE THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER FILLED WITH HALF TRUTHS AND DISTORTIONS
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
<NOISE> MR. JUNGER PREVIOUSLY HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING AND HAS SAID HE ISN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURRENCY LOSS
HE WAS SUMMARILY DISMISSED BY THE COMPANY WHEN THE CURRENCY LOSS CAME TO LIGHT ENDING HIS SEVERANCE CONTRACT THAT WAS TO RUN UNTIL SEPTEMBER
HE RESIGNED FROM V. W. IN JANUARY OVER DIFFERENCES ON HOW THE AUTO MAKER'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE RUN
THE WORLD IS MADE UP OF OPTIMISTS AND PESSIMISTS SAYS MR. STONE
IN THIS INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE THEY'RE MOSTLY PESSIMISTS
I MAY BE THE LAST OPTIMIST BUT I'M SURE I'M RIGHT
QUEBEC ENERGY MINISTER JOHN CIACCIA SAID THE PROVINCIALLY OWNED UTILITY PLANS TO APPEAL THE RULING TO THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA
NEW ENGLAND UTILITY AND ENERGY OFFICIALS SAID THE DECISION ISN'T A CAUSE FOR SERIOUS CONCERN YET BECAUSE OF THE APPEAL
THEY ADDED THAT THERE'S STILL TIME FOR NEW ENGLAND UTILITIES TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES
THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CREATION OF SUPERREGIONAL BANKS MIGHT NOT BE OPEN LONG
THEN WE WILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF CONSOLIDATING OUR POSITIONS
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
WHAT HAS DISTINGUISHED US IS THAT OUR RETURNS ON ASSETS AND EQUITY ARE FAR ABOVE AVERAGE
MAINTAINING THOSE LEVELS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE
A HOWARD METZENBAUM STAFFER SUCCESSFULLY AND POSSIBLY CRIMINALLY INTIMIDATED A BLACK LAW PROFESSOR INTO CANCELING HIS TESTIMONY
JEWEL LAFONTANT HAD TO RISK A THREATENED BOYCOTT OF REVLON TO TESTIFY FOR JUDGE BORK
A HARRIS POLL THAT INCLUDED A FALSIFIED QUOTE FROM JUDGE BORK WAS TRUMPETED TO PROVE THAT MOST AMERICANS OPPOSED JUDGE BORK
FORD'S FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS UP FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
THAT LARGE JUMP ENABLED FORD TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE U. S. NEW CAR MARKET TO TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT FROM EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
AFTER HIS ORIENTATION MR. BOESKY WILL BE ASSIGNED A REGULAR JOB
THOUGH HE CAN STATE A PREFERENCE MR. SAMS SAID MR. BOESKY WILL GO WHERE THE PRISON NEEDS HIM
HE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE MOST DESIRABLE JOBS ARE SNAPPED UP BY INMATES WITH MORE SENIORITY
<NOISE> THE DESIRABLE JOBS MR. SAMS SAID ARE AT THE PRISON'S FACTORY WHICH MAKES WOODEN FURNITURE FOR FEDERAL OFFICES THE DAIRY FARM AND THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
MEANWHILE AUDI SET UP A BONUS PLAN TO ENCOURAGE DEALERSHIP SALESPEOPLE TO SELL AUDI EIGHTY AND NINETY CARS NEWER MODELS THAT CARRY FAR LESS GENEROUS INCENTIVES
UNDER THE BONUS PLAN AUDI PROMISED TO GIVE SALES PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EVERY TIME THEY SOLD AN EIGHTY OR NINETY MODEL
LAW OFFICIALS FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE SAID THEY'RE OPENING INQUIRIES INTO AUDI'S REBATES
<NOISE> MORE STATES ARE CONSIDERING SUCH LEGISLATION WHICH IS BEING PROMOTED BY IRISH AMERICAN POLITICIANS AND PRESSURE GROUPS AND WHICH SINN FEIN SUPPORTS
WE EXPECT TO FACE CHALLENGES IN QUITE A NUMBER OF STATES SAYS SIMON JOHNSTON OF THE PROVINCE'S DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
<NOISE> WE COULD HAVE HAD MORE AMERICAN FUNDS AND WE HAVE NOT GOT THEM AND MACBRIDE IS PART OF THE REASON THE DEPARTMENT'S GERRY LAVERY SAYS
MR. LEPPO WAS CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AT ALLIED FROM AUGUST NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN UNTIL LAST JULY
HE AND MS. FORTUNE SAID MR. CAMPEAU ENCOURAGED THEM TO BID FOR ANN TAYLOR
MS. FORTUNE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ANN TAYLOR FOR THE PAST ONE AND A HALF YEARS
BUT THE LAWMAKERS ACTUALLY SPENT ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LEGISLATION THIS FISCAL YEAR
AND SO FAR HARDLY ANY OF THE PROMISED ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING
WE LOST OUR BILL CONCEDES SENATOR MOYNIHAN A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT
THE INESCAPABLE FACT HOWEVER IS THAT ONE DAY THE WATER IS GOING TO RUN OUT OR BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE TO PUMP UP
WE'RE GOING TO SEE LESS PRODUCTION
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT SAYS KANSAS STATE EXTENSION ECONOMIST MARK NELSON
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A *CATACLYSMIC* THING
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT THE OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAYS THE MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
THE TREASURY MARKET GOT OFF TO A WEAK START OVERNIGHT IN TOKYO WHERE LIMITED SELLING AMONG JAPANESE INVESTORS PUSHED PRICES AS MUCH AS A QUARTER POINT LOWER
WHEN THE MARKET OPENED IN THE U. S. PRICES REMAINED LOWER THROUGHOUT THE DAY
EVEN A STRONGER DOLLAR AND LOWER COMMODITY PRICES FAILED TO INSPIRE CONFIDENCE IN THE BOND MARKET
STATES ARE GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT WELFARE REFORM BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO SUBSIDIZE <NOISE> A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR RESIDENTS IN PERPETUITY
A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INCREASED WELFARE SPENDING WILL NOT MAKE A DENT IN POVERTY
TO THE CONTRARY THE SPENDING MAY ACTUALLY HAVE CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS FAMILY DISSOLUTION ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS AND CHR:ONIC UNEMPLOYMENT
MORE ENLIGHTENED WELFARE POLICY MUST ABATE NOT EXACERBATE THESE PROBLEMS
A MISCALCULATION PROMPTED CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FIRST
<NOISE> <NOISE> LEGISLATORS WORRIED THAT PROPOSITION THIRTEEN TAX RESTRAINTS WOULD FORCE BIG LAYOFFS OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS HURRIEDLY PASSED A SHORT TIME COMPENSATION LAW IN JULY NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
THOSE LAYOFFS NEVER CAME BUDGET SURPLUSES PERMITTED STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RETAIN STAFFS

MANAGERS AT THE PLANTS MUST MAKE UP ANY RESULTING LOSSES BY SLASHING BONUSES
MS. OATES DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT PERSONAL POWER ABOUT BEING ABLE TO STAND UP TO OTHERS
BUT THE FEELING OF POWER AND CONFIDENCE IS WHAT WE LADY BOXERS AGREED WE LIKED MOST ABOUT OUR NEW SKILL
<NOISE> IT IS ALSO WHY WE ADVOCATE BOXING FOR ALL ESPECIALLY FOR LITTLE GIRLS WHO ARE STILL RAISED TO BELIEVE THEY DON'T HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN A MAN'S WORLD
SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL

THE PAC MAN DEFENSE IS NAMED AFTER THE VIDEO GAME IN WHICH A PLAYER TRIES TO GOBBLE UP HIS FOE BEFORE THE PLAYER IS SWALLOWED
THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY WOULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
<NOISE> NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES

PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS
TAXES WOULD GO UP FOR CORPORATIONS CONSISTING OF LAWYERS DOCTORS ACCOUNTANTS AND ARCHITECTS
THE PROVISION WOULD ELIMINATE GRADUATED RATES FOR THESE PERSONAL SERVICE CORPORATIONS SO THAT THEY ALL WOULD PAY THE FLAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT CORPORATE RATE
WHY SHOULD FOREIGN IMPORTS BE A BETTER MEASURE OF U. S. EXPORTS
AND WHY ARE THE EXPORT DATA SO BAD
IMPORT DATA ARE DIRECTLY COLLECTED BY A SINGLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THEY PROVIDE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS AND THEY PROVIDE POLITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES OF GOODS SUBJECT TO QUOTAS
THESE ASPECTS OF IMPORT ACCOUNTING ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO AMASS ACCURATE IMPORT DATA
CONVERSELY FOR EXPORTS SELF INTEREST INDUCES UNDERREPORTING
THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES
GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX

KIDDER'S MR. FREEDMAN AND JOSEPH KOZLOFF AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT RAISED THEIR ESTIMATES TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE FROM EIGHT DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS
I CAN SEE A NUMBER CLOSE TO TEN DOLLARS FOR NINETEEN NINETY ONE SAYS MR. KOZLOFF
THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
THE TRASH
PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
UNLIKE MORE ECLECTIC RAIDERS MR. TRUMP HAS SO FAR STUCK TO REAL ESTATE
RESORTS HAS BIG UNDEVELOPED LAND HOLDINGS IN ATLANTIC CITY
ALLEGIS' WESTIN PLAZA HOTEL WHICH HE SEEMS TO WANT COULD BE WORTH TWICE AS MUCH IF MADE INTO CONDOMINIUMS HE SAYS
HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST
SALES OF BUILDING MATERIALS INCREASED ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AFTER A POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP
OVERALL SALES OF DURABLE GOODS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO LAST THREE YEARS OR MORE FELL POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER RISING THREE POINT ONE PERCENT IN AUGUST
WALL STREET IN GENERAL HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT G. M. IN RECENT WEEKS BECAUSE OF ITS NEW LABOR CONTRACT
THE THREE YEAR PACT INCLUDES A JOB SECURITY PROGRAM THAT PREVENTS LAYOFFS EXCEPT DURING A SALES DROP PREVENTS PLANT CLOSINGS AND SLOWS ATTRITION
MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE PROVISIONS WILL HAMPER G. M.'S EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE OPERATIONS <NOISE> AND SHED <NOISE> UNCOMPETITIVE PLANTS PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OPERATIONS
MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
I AM ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
YOU CAN TOO
ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE N- TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
<NOISE> THE OTHER EUROPEAN MARKETS ALSO POSTED DECLINES
STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN PARIS ZURICH BRUSSELS AMSTERDAM STOCKHOLM AND MILAN
JOINING THE CROWD WERE SHARE PRICES IN SYDNEY WELLINGTON TAIPEI MANILA HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE
WHILE MR. ARROYO WORKED IN PRESIDENT AQUINO'S OFFICE AND SAW HER EVERY DAY MR. ONGPIN WAS STILL HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD BARGAINING WITH THE BANKERS
TO CHEER ON HIS EXHAUSTED TEAM MEMBERS HE OUTFITTED THEM ONE DAY IN YELLOW NECKTIES THE COLOR OF THE AQUINO REVOLUTION
ON MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH MR. ONGPIN REACHED A DEAL
THE ROAD NAMED WEST STREET IS A NARROW STRIP OF RED GRAVEL
IT IS LIKE THE PROVERBIAL RAILROAD TRACKS IN AMERICA THAT SEPARATE THE RICH SIDE OF TOWN FROM THE POOR
THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE MAY NOT BE GREAT BUT THE MENTAL GAP IS
THE INDICATED TIGHTNESS IN U. S. GASOLINE OUGHT TO PREVENT THE REFINERS' FLAT OUT PRODUCTION FROM LEADING TO A PRODUCT PRICE WAR
THE DECLINE IN CRUDE PRICES EVENTUALLY WILL END HOWEVER
OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE
AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY
BUT MR. RANDOL SUGGESTS THAT A TREND TOWARD PERMANENTLY IMPROVED REFINER MARGINS IS SUSTAINABLE
THROUGH ITS U. S. FINANCE SUBSIDIARY TOYOTA HAS ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE U. S. AND PRIVATELY PLACED MEDIUM TERM NOTES
IT HAS ALSO RAISED MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE EUROMARKETS BUT SO FAR HAS AVOIDED ISSUING STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE PUBLIC U. S. MARKET
THE SAME IS TRUE OF MOST JAPANESE COMPANIES
RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN <NOISE>
MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
STOCK PRICES CLIMBED IN ACTIVE TRADING
VOLUME ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE TOTALED ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SHARES
ADVANCING ISSUES ON THE BIG BOARD WERE AHEAD OF DECLINERS EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX TO SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
<NOISE> YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS MR. WU SAID
TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE
TO MANY OBSERVERS THE SITE WILL BE A BONANZA FOR WHOEVER DEVELOPS IT
IT'S ONE OF THE FINEST PIECES OF LAND THAT YOU CAN FIND SAYS SANFORD GOODKIN A MARINA DEL REY CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSULTANT
YOU COULD BUILD ALMOST ANYTHING THERE HOUSING OFFICES RETAIL AND IT WOULD BE A SURE FIRE SUCCESS
ADDS ROB MAGUIRE OF MAGUIRE THOMAS PARTNERS A LOS ANGELES BASED OFFICE DEVELOPER IT'S A TERRIFIC LOCATION
DOCTOR MCDONALD THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WAS THE FIRST PHYSICIAN TO EXAMINE MR. BALLARD'S BODY
HE BELIEVES THAT MR. BALLARD'S BOOTS COULD HAVE SHOWN EVIDENCE OF ELECTRIC SHOCK
BURN MARKS ON THE YOUNG MINER'S RIGHT ARM FIRST LED DOCTOR MCDONALD TO SUSPECT ELECTROCUTION
<NOISE> THIS MAN WAS COVERED WITH COAL DUST AND HIS CLOTHING WAS WET SAYS DOCTOR MCDONALD TODAY
HE COULD BE LIKE A WALKING ELECTRODE
THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
MR. BOTHA W- ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON THE PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE EVENTS LOVED THEM
THE CITIZENS OF NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT A TERRIFIC FEELING THE WEEKEND ENGENDERED IN EVERYONE
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAS SO HAPPY THAT IT IS USING A PHOTO FROM LIBERTY WEEKEND IN ADVERTISEMENTS TO ATTRACT BUSINESS TO THE STATE
THOSE WHO WATCHED THE EVENTS ON TELEVISION MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS LOVED THEM
PEOPLE IN FIFTY ONE FOREIGN COUNTRIES ENJOYED THE EVENTS VIA TELEVISION
THE FRENCH WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE CELEBRATION THEY THANKED THE U. S. IN AN AD IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS
COMMUNIQUES ANNOUNCING COMPLETION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS WERE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER FOUR NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NOVEMBER NINE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
IT IS SAD BUT TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EXTRAVAGANZAS HAVE COME TO BE CONDUCTED AMID THE SORT OF SECURITY OTHERWISE RESERVED FOR THE TRAVELS OF HEADS OF STATE
THE SWISS HOCKEY COACH WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HIS PLAYERS WERE SURPRISED THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW THEIR PASSES AT THE BLUE LINE WHEN THEY BACK CHECKED
HAVING THE BAR PATTERN ON MY PASS CHECKED ELECTRONICALLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TIMES MADE ME FEEL LIKE A TOOTHPASTE CARTON LEAVING A SUPERMARKET
<NOISE> ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
<NOISE> THIRD NEW LOANS WOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE
FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LENDING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
<NOISE> IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
WITH THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AS ITS PRIME CUSTOMER TRACOR WAS HELPLESS WHEN DEFENSE SPENDING SLOWED
INTERNALLY MR. INMAN SAYS HE DISCOVERED THAT EXPENSES COULDN'T BE CUT AS EASILY AS BANKERS HAD FORECAST
AND FEES WERE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED
MR. INMAN CALLS IT ALL PART OF MY EDUCATION
THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
IT'S SO SHUNNED THAT ALTHOUGH MOST MANAGERS GOING UP THE LADDER ARE OCCASIONALLY REQUIRED TO FIRE ONCE HAVING ASCENDED TO THE TOP THEY DELEGATE THE JOB
ANDREW SHERWOOD A NEW YORK MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT SAYS THAT ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES DO THEIR OWN FIRING
<NOISE> THESE ARE C- PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPULSIVE BUILDERS HE SAYS
THEY LIKE ACQUIRING COMPANIES MAKING PROFITS GO UP AND RECRUITING PEOPLE
FIRING ISN'T WHAT THEY'RE EMOTIONALLY GEARED FOR
THEY FIND IT REPUGNANT
DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE
MR. AMMAN FORTY NINE YEARS OLD SAID HE BELIEVES WESTERN UNION'S DEBT AND EQUITY HOLDERS WILL SUPPORT THE RESTRUCTURING
HE ADDED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS RUNNING SHORT OF CASH
WESTERN UNION HAS SAID THAT IF ITS PLANS ARE DEFEATED IT WILL FILE FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORP. CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
<NOISE> BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TO THREE BILLION TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS
SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AS UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
ANOTHER BANK TRADER ATTRIBUTES THE DOLLAR'S REBOUND TO FED OFFICIALS' INCREASED OPENNESS ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITIES
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THEIR BUCK RIGHT NOW THE TRADER SAYS
THEY WANT PEOPLE TO RUN OUT AND SAY THE FED'S BUYING THE FED'S BUYING
THAT'S WHAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FED'S INTERVENTION THIS YEAR
DOW PRESIDENT FRANK POPOFF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME INCREASES BOLSTERED EARNINGS
THE COMPANY'S STRONG COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS ALSO HELPED
COSTS REMAIN STABLE VOLUME HAS INCREASED AND THERE IS NO WEAKNESS APPARENT IN EITHER THE PRODUCT LINES OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MR. POPOFF SAID
FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
<NOISE> WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
AND REVENUES SLUMP
BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE'S STILL AN IMAGE PROBLEM
IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS
THE ORDERS TYPICALLY BAR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF RECORDS AND DEPOSITIONS EVEN AFTER A SETTLEMENT OR VERDICT
PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS GENERALLY HAVEN'T BALKED AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PREPARE FOR THEIR TRIALS
IN THE NEW CONSUMERIST CHILE THIS IS A MAN WHO DOESN'T EVEN OWN A CAR
THE SON OF A RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER HE LIVES QUIETLY WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS IN A SMALL HOUSE IN SANTIAGO
HE PREFERS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN TO THE WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINES
HIS TRAINING WAS AS A MINING ENGINEER NOT AS AN ECONOMIST
AMONG HIS RECENT READING THE EYE OF THE FLY
THE APPOINTMENT CONTINUED TO LANGUISH AND ON JUNE ONE DOCTOR SULLIVAN CALLED MR. FULTON AND SUGGESTED THAT HE WITHDRAW HIS NAME FROM CONSIDERATION
DOCTOR SULLIVAN HAD CONCLUDED THAT EVEN IF HE PUSHED THE FULTON NOMINATION THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THE PRICE OF VICTORY WOULD BE TOO HIGH
HE WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE WRATH OF THE LIGHT RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY MR. FULTON SAYS
BUT TEXAS AMERICAN MAY HAVE ITS PROBLEMS WITH THE PROPOSED COMBINATION OF REPUBLICBANK AND INTERFIRST
BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE ALONE THEY WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE STATE MR. GRANT ADDED
EXACTLY WHAT IMPACT THAT COMPETITION WILL HAVE IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS NOW HE SAID
EARLIER THIS FALL TANDON BORROWED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM FOOTHILL CAPITAL CORP. UNDER A SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT LINE OF AS MUCH AS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
ALSO A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SHORT TERM LOAN FROM XEROX CORP. WAS CONVERTED INTO A LONG TERM NOTE
THE NOTE IS CONVERTIBLE INTO TANDON COMMON STOCK
LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCIES OF THE U. S. AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED
BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY
AND AS THE CANADIAN UNIT RISES IT LURES MORE F:OREIGN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY FROM JAPAN WHICH ADDS TO ITS STRENGTH
MR. CRUZ SAID HE HAD SET DEADLINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORMS HE WAS PROPOSING
HE SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE EXPECTED THAT THE INTEGRATION OF THE NEW REBEL ARMY WOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF JUNE
HE WARNED THAT HE WOULD DENOUNCE ANY EFFORT TO SIDETRACK THE REFORMS INDICATING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE REBEL ORGANIZATION IF HIS PLANS WEREN'T CARRIED OUT
TRADERS SAID FINANCIAL ISSUES PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL BANKS WERE STRONG AS WERE REAL ESTATE COMPANIES AND RETAILERS
CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL SHARES AND CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING STOCKS GENERALLY EASED ON LATE PROFIT TAKING
EXPORT LED SHARES WERE MIXED TO WEAKER
EXCO A UNIT OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS P. L. C. IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BROKERS OF INTERBANK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSITS
UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT HOLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAME HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW
PEOPLE THINK THE A. IN A- A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
MEDICAL RESEARCHERS REPORTED MORE EVIDENCE THAT A CANCER VIRUS IS CONTAMINATING THE NATION'S SUPPLY OF BANKED BLOOD
SOME NEW YORK CITY HOSPITAL PATIENTS WHO HAD RECEIVED MULTIPLE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS HAD BEEN INFECTED WITH H. T. L. V. ONE
THE PRESENCE OF THE VIRUS IN THE BLOOD SUPPLY POSES A PUBLIC HEALTH DILEMMA
IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF
AND IT SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER
MR. BRODY WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
<NOISE> A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND AN APPEALS COURT BOTH IN RICHMOND UPHELD THE PLAN
BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THE APPEALS COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION IN LIGHT OF ANOTHER HIGH COURT RULING
<NOISE> LAST YEAR THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST
PAST SOCIETAL BIAS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BASIS TO JUSTIFY THE PLAN THE APPEALS COURT SAID IN AN OPINION WRITTEN BY JUDGE J. HARVIE WILKINSON THE THIRD
CHRYSLER IS RESUMING EXPORTS TO EUROPE AFTER ITS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FORCED IT TO LEAVE THE MARKET
THE COMPANY PLANS TO SHIP VERSIONS OF ITS DODGE SHADOW DODGE DAYTONA SHELBY Z. PLYMOUTH VOYAGER AND THE LEBARON SEDAN COUPE AND CONVERTIBLE

AGFA GEVAERT ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK IT WOULD SEEK TO ACQUIRE THE EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF MATRIX IT DIDN'T ALREADY OWN FOR TEN DOLLARS A SHARE
MATRIX SAID AT THAT TIME THAT ITS BOARD REVIEWED THE OFFER BUT THE RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW WEREN'T ANNOUNCED
THE ADVERTISEMENT ANNOUNCING THE TENDER OFFER SAYS A MERGER AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE TWO FIRMS LAST WEEK
IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANCE BY INSTANCE CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS
THE OFFICIAL ALSO SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE

THE EXISTING BENCHMARK THIRTY YEAR BONDS ENDED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS LOWER OR DOWN THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
THE ISSUE'S YIELD WHICH MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM ITS PRICE WAS QUOTED LATE AT EIGHT POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT

THE NEW TEN YEAR NOTES WERE QUOTED WHEN ISSUED TRADING AT ABOUT NINETY NINE AND FOURTEEN THIRTY SECONDS TO YIELD EIGHT POINT OH SIX FIVE PERCENT
THE FOLLOWING LETTER HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ONE THOUSAND CHINESE CITIZENS WHO ARE STUDYING IN THE U. S.
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HAVE ALLOWED THEIR NAMES TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE U. S. CHINESE LANGUAGE PRESS THE REST HAVE REQUESTED *ANONYMITY*
A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
THE POINT VIRTUALLY EVERY ADVERTISER IN EVERY MEDIUM IS PAYING TO REACH VIEWERS OR READERS WHO NEVER BECOME CUSTOMERS
MR. LI MADE HIS ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY AFTER THE STOCK MARKET HERE HAD CLOSED
BUT NEWS OF THE PLANNED OFFERING HAD LEAKED EARLIER IN THE DAY WHEN HIS COMPANIES SOUGHT A SUSPENSION IN TRADING OF THEIR SHARES
THE MARKET FELL SENDING THE HANG SENG INDEX FIFTY TWO POINTS LOWER AT ONE POINT
THE INDEX LATER RECOVERED TO CLOSE WITH A TEN POINT SIX SIX POINTS LOSS AT THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT FOUR
ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
LAWRENCE FLEISHER THE UNION'S GENERAL COUNSEL SAID THAT THE UNION HAD SOUGHT AN EXPEDITED PROCEEDING IN THE HOPES OF AVOIDING A LOCKOUT OR STRIKE
HE DIDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRIKE BUT SAID THAT PLAYERS ARE FREE TO SIGN CONTRACTS AND REPORT TO TRAINING CAMP OCTOBER NINTH
THE N. B. A. SEASON BEGINS NOVEMBER SIXTH
THE ACADEMY'S FEARS ABOUT SOLICITING VOTES HOWEVER MAY BE EXAGGERATED
SAYS BOOKER MCCLAY A PUBLICIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN PROMOTING MOVIES FOR OSCARS YOU CAN'T BUY THE VOTERS
THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT AND VERY JADED
ACADEMY MEMBERS HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PICTURES HE ADDS AND YOU CAN'T HUSTLE THEM
IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
BUT NETWORK OFFICIALS WILL SPEND MONTHS DEBATING C. B. S.'S WISDOM
IT'S TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE SAID MR. PAULSON TESTILY TAKING ON REPORTERS AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE
I'M UP TO HERE STATING C. B. S. HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS AND N. B. C. HASN'T
AT N. B. C. MR. WATSON WAS PHILOSOPHIC IF PRAGMATIC YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A WINNER HE SAID
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AT THE SAME TIME
ONE FORMER INVESTIGATOR WHO WORKED ON THE PRESSER INVESTIGATION SAID THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL SUIT BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO DORMANT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE TEAMSTERS LEADER
THE EX LABOR DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATOR NOTED THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF REQUIRED IN A RICO CIVIL SUIT IS LESS THAN UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES
HE SAID ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AGAINST MR. PRESSER SHOULD BE EASIER TO GAIN THROUGH PRETRIAL DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY
NOR IS THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN A MAGIC NUMBER STRESSED DOCTOR SHAW
IF WE HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY COPIES WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT VIRUSES HE SAID
HE TERMED THE SPEED OF MUTATION EXTRAORDINARY AND COMPARED THE AIDS VIRUS WITH OTHER SWIFTLY CHANGING VIRUSES SUCH AS INFLUENZA
ANOTHER POTENTIAL POINT OF CONTENTION IS THE E. C.'S PLAN TO ALLOW THE FREE FLOW OF PEOPLE ACROSS BORDERS
SWITZERLAND HAS ALREADY ATTRACTED ONE MILLION RESIDENT ALIENS A PORTION OF ITS POPULATION GREATER THAN ANY E. C. STATE EXCEPT LUXEMBOURG
MOST SWISS THINK THAT THAT IS ENOUGH AND THE COUNTRY HAS IMPOSED FOREIGN WORKER QUOTAS SO STRICT THAT THE SKILLED LABOR IS IN SHORT SUPPLY
YET IF SWITZERLAND CLOSES ITS DOOR TO MORE E. C. NATIONALS SWISS WHO WORK IN THE E. C. MAY FIND THEMSELVES LESS WELCOME
HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

S. E. C. CHAIRMAN DAVID RUDER PRESENTED THE UNANIMOUS POSITION OF THE FIVE MEMBER COMMISSION AT A MEETING YESTERDAY OF SECURITY REGULATORS IN MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA
MR. RUDER SAID THAT AN EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR A GLOBAL MARKET SHOULD INCLUDE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS FOR DISSEMINATING MARKET DATA ON PRICES AND TRADING VOLUME AND FOR EXECUTING TRADES
HE ADDED THAT ULTIMATELY ALL COUNTRIES SHOULD SET UP AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR CLEARING AND SETTLING EQUITY AND DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND THAT MANY SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD BE LINKED
THE GOVERNMENT SOURCE WHO REQUESTED *ANONYMITY* SAID THE MEASURE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE CONFISCATION OF FUNDS IN ADDITION TO FINES AND IMPRISONMENT
LOCAL PRESS REPORTS SAID THAT FINES OF UP TO FIFTY MILLION LUXEMBOURG FRANCS (PARENTHESES ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND PRISON TERMS OF UP TO FIVE YEARS COULD BE IMPOSED
THE PROPOSED LAW IS EXPECTED TO GAIN PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL AND GO INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR
THE COMMUNISTS COULDN'T SOLVE POLAND'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SO THEY NEEDED TO BRING IN SOLIDARITY HE SAID
IN CHINA TOO THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERS CAN'T OVERCOME OUR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES
THEY WILL NEED OUR HELP
THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR EXAMPLE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPOINTED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
YESTERDAY MINET HOLDINGS P. L. C. SAID ITS PLANNED NUMBER TEN POINT FIVE MILLION CONTRIBUTION COULD RISE TO NUMBER TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION
LLOYD'S DECLINED TO SPECULATE HOW MUCH ITS CONTRIBUTION MIGHT INCREASE
FOX HAS ALSO STIRRED UP ADVERTISER INTEREST BECAUSE IT HAS PERFORMED WELL IN SOME MARKETS ESPECIALLY BIG CITIES LIKE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON WHERE IT OWNS AND OPERATES STATIONS
IN WASHINGTON TWENTY ONE JUMP STREET HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO SHOW IN ITS TIME PERIOD ACCORDING TO MR. KELLNER
MARRIED WITH CHILDREN HAS REGULARLY SCORED HIGHER THAN ONE OR TWO OF THE OFFERINGS ON THE THREE NETWORKS HE ADDS
IN NEW YORK SOME FOX PROGRAMS HAVE ALSO GARNERED HIGHER RATINGS THAN SHOWS ON THE THREE NETWORKS
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE INVESTIGATION OF MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT HAS LED TO AN UNPRECEDENTED EXAMINATION OF THE LARGELY UNREGULATED SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET
THIS IN TURN HAS LED TO CALLS FROM FINANCIERS AND POLITICIANS FOR CLOSER REGULATION OF THIS HUGE MARKET
THE INVESTIGATION CENTERS ON WHETHER BOND ISSUES SOLD AS *TAX* EXEMPT BY MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT AND OTHER UNDERWRITERS ACTUALLY WARRANT TAX EXEMPT STATUS
MOST ARAB STATES BROKE OFF RELATIONS WITH EGYPT WHEN THAT COUNTRY SIGNED A PEACE TREATY WITH ISRAEL EIGHT YEARS AGO
OMAN SUDAN AND SOMALIA DIDN'T CUT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT
JORDAN AND DJIBOUTI DID BUT HAVE SINCE RESTORED RELATIONS
MR. PERRY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD JOINED CANADAIR IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND IS IN CHARGE OF SALES OF THE COMPANY'S CHALLENGER BUSINESS JET
MR. PERRY WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT BUT A CANADAIR SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE INDICTMENT WAS QUITE A SHOCK BOTH TO THE COMPANY AND TO MR. PERRY
HE'S AN OUTSTANDING EXECUTIVE SHE SAID
JIM POYNER AN ANALYST WITH RAUSCHER PIERCE REFENES INCORPORATED IN DALLAS SAID THEY THE GROUP MAY RUN INTO SOME RESISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS
THE COMPANY IS WORTH AT LEAST A FEW DOLLARS PER SHARE MORE THAN THIS
I THINK IF ANOTHER COMPANY WERE TRYING TO BUY STERLING THEY'D HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN THIS
THE CONTINUING PROSPECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES SENT STOCK PRICES UP SHARPLY
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE CLOSED UP TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE EIGHT POINTS AT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT POINT TWO TWO
VOLUME ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE TOTALED TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION SHARES UP FROM ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES TRADED TUESDAY
ADVANCING ISSUES LED DECLINERS ONE THOUSAND FIFTY FOUR TO FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE
IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF
AND IT SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER
MR. BRODY WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
STILL MS. FREEDMAN NOTED THAT A BRIGHT FORECAST FOR HIRING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL GOOD NEWS
THE INCREASING USE OF LABOR MAY BE BECAUSE OF A TREMENDOUS BOOM IN THE OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES SHE SAID
BUT IT ALSO MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU AREN'T IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH YOU USE THE LABOR FORCE THE PRODUCTIVITY
RICHARD ROSLUND A VICE PRESIDENT OF BLOCK TRADING AT KIDDER PEABODY SAID THE FED'S CHAIRMAN'S REMARKS GAVE THE MARKET A REASON TO ADOPT A MORE POSITIVE OUTLOOK
PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO GRASP ON HE SAID
IT'S BEEN SUCH A PESSIMISTIC ATMOSPHERE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
ANALYSTS SAY THEY EXPECT P. AND G'S MOMENTUM TO CARRY INTO NINETEEN NINETY AND BEYOND AND MANY RAISED THEIR FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY ESTIMATES
BRENDA LEE LANDRY OF MORGAN STANLEY RAISED HER ESTIMATE TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS FROM AN EARLIER ESTIMATE OF EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS
KIDDER'S MR. FREEDMAN AND JOSEPH KOZLOFF AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT RAISED THEIR ESTIMATES TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE FROM EIGHT DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS

FROM MR. CASEY'S AND MR. GATES'S TESTIMONY IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW SPECIFIC LIEUTENANT COLONEL NORTH WAS AT THE OCTOBER LUNCHEON
CRITICS OF THE DIRECTOR HAVE ARGUED THAT HE FOLLOWED A CALCULATED PATTERN OF REMOVING HIMSELF FROM KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE FORMAL NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF MEMBER WAS DOING
MR. CASEY HAS CAST HIMSELF AS TAKING ORDERS IN SOME CASES FROM THE LIEUTENANT COLONEL A SOURCE SAID
MORE GENERALLY WITHIN THE C. I. A. OPERATIVES ARE VAGUE ABOUT WHAT THEY OBSERVED OF THE PRIVATE SUPPLY NETWORK
ONE NORTH KOREAN ASSERTION DOES HAVE A CERTAIN SCARY CREDIBILITY TO IT
NORTH KOREA SAYS THAT BLOWING UP AN EXPENSIVE DAM TO FLOOD THE SOUTH WOULD BE A WASTE OF GOOD EXPLOSIVES
TO DO THE JOB WOULD TAKE A BLAST EQUIVALENT TO A NUCLEAR BOMB
<NOISE> BETTER TO DROP IT DIRECTLY ON SEOUL
THAT WOULD BE A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER IN DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT SAYS LI CHOONG SUNG THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE NORTH KOREAN POWER COMMISSION
FARM BANKS ACCOUNT FOR A MAJOR PORTION OF THE RISING NUMBERS OF BANK FAILURES
OF THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT FEDERALLY INSURED BANKS THAT FAILED LAST YEAR FIFTY NINE HAD MADE MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THEIR LOANS IN AGRICULTURE
MORE THAN HALF OF THESE FARM BANKS WERE IN KANSAS IOWA MISSOURI AND NEBRASKA
EVEN LESS APPRECIATED IS THE TURMOIL THAT OFTEN RESULTS FOR WOMEN
WHEN HE STARTED BECOMING IMPOTENT I HAD ALL KINDS OF WORRIES AND STRANGE THOUGHTS SAYS MAGGIE A BOSTON WOMAN WHO LIVES WITH HER FIANCE
<NOISE> I THOUGHT I WAS DOING SOMETHING WRONG OR THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE ME OR THAT HE WAS GAY
SHE SAYS IT WAS A WONDERFUL RELIEF WHEN DOCTORS TRACED HIS PROBLEM TO NERVE DAMAGE FROM BACK SURGERY AND TREATED IT WITH A MUSCLE RELAXING DRUG
AND AMONG WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT HAS PLENTY OF SUPPORT
MANY PARTICULARLY THE AFRIKANERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEFENDING THEIR WAY OF LIFE FOR THREE CENTURIES STRONGLY BACK THE ARMY'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST COMMUNIST FORCES IN ANGOLA AND *NAMIBIA*
THEY ARE EQUALLY DETERMINED TO REPEL AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS TERRORISM INSIDE SOUTH AFRICA
TO THESE PEOPLE THE E. C. C. IS NOTHING BUT A BAND OF LEFT WING COWARDS
OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WASTE MANAGEMENT'S BOARDS MEET

OFFICIALS AT THE COMPANY SAY CHEMLAWN DIDN'T BELONG ON THE AGENDA UNDER PENDING ACQUISITIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
THAT IS TWO DOLLARS TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID
CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
PERHAPS THE HOOVER OVERSEERS SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THEY PONDER THE LATEST AFFRONT TO GLENN CAMPBELL NEXT YEAR
THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
THE SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
AND THOUGH MR. DINGHAM WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEM TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
SEPARATELY JUDGE BROWNING ISSUED A RULING ON THE AWARD OF ANY DAMAGES IN THE CASE
FOR CLAIMS IN THE FEDERAL CASE THE STANDARD OF DAMAGE IS OUT OF POCKET OR INVESTORS' LOSS ON THE BONDS
FOR WASHINGTON STATE CLAIMS THE STANDARD IS RECISSION WHICH COULD MEAN *REPAYING* BONDHOLDERS THEIR PURCHASE PRICE
THE DISPUTE IS A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MARKET PHILOSOPHIES
WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKETS

FINALLY SOME PREDICT STATES WILL TAKE THE LEAD IN EXPANDING BANK POWERS
ALREADY TWENTY TWO STATES GIVE THEIR BANKS MORE FREEDOM THAN FEDERALLY CHARTERED BANKS HAVE TO ENGAGE IN INSURANCE AND REAL ESTATE
CALIFORNIA HAS A BALLOT REFERENDUM THIS FALL ON LETTING BANKS SELL INSURANCE
DELAWARE CURRENTLY ALLOWS SOME *SECURITIES* UNDERWRITING BY STATE CHARTERED BANKS MS. SHAW NOTES AND NEW YORK HAS DEBATED A SIMILAR MOVE
THE TRASH
PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE AFTER TAXES
IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR KODAK SAYS ALEX
BROWN ANALYST OTIS BRADLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
IT REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A A SHARE

BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR
SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
ALBERT GROSS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT REFCO INCORPORATED AGREED
THE BOND MARKET WAS HELPED TEMPORARILY BY A DECLINE IN GOLD AND OTHER COMMODITY PRICES A STRENGTHENING DOLLAR AND A STOCK MARKET RALLY HE SAID
BUT I EXPECT THE DOLLAR TO CONTINUE FALLING AND THAT WILL ACCELERATE INFLATION PRESSURES
THE BEST NUMBERS ON INFLATION ARE BEHIND US
MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS
BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY
THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK
BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
MR. REAGAN'S COMMENTS DON'T REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION AGREEMENT
AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE THE PLAN SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD EITHER SIGN OR VETO THE SPECIFIC TAXES CONGRESS CHOOSES
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID BEFORE THAT IT ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROVISION ON TAKEOVERS
HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR
THERE'S A LOT BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS
THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS
MOBIL BASED IN NEW YORK SAID ITS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME JUMPED NINETY TWO PERCENT
THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF REPLY
ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE <NOISE>
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
WHEN MS. HIGA TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX FROZEN PIZZA WAS STILL A LONG SHOT
THE AVERAGE JAPANESE DIDN'T HAVE FREEZER SPACE LET ALONE AN OVEN
AND THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE TO SUPERMARKET TASTE TESTS WAS THAT CHEESE LOOKED AND TASTED LIKE SOAP SHE RECALLS
BUT SHE KEPT GOING PEDDLING HER PIZZAS TO RESTAURANTS AND FANCY HOTELS
<NOISE> SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
<NOISE> IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
A LOSS WASN'T UNEXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER THIS YEAR
INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
<NOISE> I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
<NOISE> I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SAID MESSRS.
SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO THE VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
CANDICE BERGEN AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM
I OFTEN THINK OBSERVED MS. BERGEN THAT IF DOSTOEVSKI HAD BEEN A SINGER HE'D HAVE SOUNDED LIKE RAY CHARLES
THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS
IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO ZERO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO ZERO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
<NOISE> MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE TO BE NO BIDS AT ALL
THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY S- SUGAR COMPANY
HE SAYS HE COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS <NOISE>
WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
<NOISE> I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST *LENINIST* STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
WE'LL SEE
WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS *REASSURANCE* TO OUR MANAGERS
SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE S:ANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY
LIKE TANDY'S THOSE MACHINES ARE ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY ANALYSTS SAY
COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION HAS ROLLED TWO CLUB CARS INTO TOWN TO ENTERTAIN DEMOCRATS
THE COMPANY IS HEADED BY DREW LEWIS FREQUENTLY A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE REPUBLICANS
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR *ALTERNATES* TO THIS CONVENTION
DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT I- IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
WHAT IS MEANT BY THIS IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SET WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID <NOISE>

I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD HYMAN OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INCORPORATED SAYS
REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS USUALLY IS WRONG
THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST <NOISE>
OTHER TOY MAKERS SUCH AS MATTEL INCORPORATED HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS EARLIER IN THE YEAR TO INCREASE SALES AT TIMES OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS
BUT TYCO'S DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS LAUNCH IS UNUSUAL
THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW
<NOISE> NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
THE BANK OF ITALY ALSO REPORTEDLY SOLD MARKS TO BUY ITALIAN LIRE
THE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MAINLY AT DEFENDING THE SAGGING LIRA IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH EIGHT EUROPEAN CURRENCIES FLOAT WITHIN SPECIFIED LIMITS
BUT THEY ALSO HAD EFFECT OF HELPING THE DOLLAR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF MARKS IN THE MARKET
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT WHICH LIKE MR. KIRK RELISHES AN EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE THE OIL SPILL HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF ATTENTION

THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR
THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF *SUBSTANTIVE* GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT
AND A MESSAGE THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WILL BE STRONGLY DELIVERED
MR. TUCKER'S HARD HITTING CAMPAIGN HAS IN TURN APPALLED TOP UNION LEADERS WHO SAY HE HAS TARNISHED THEIR REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT'S CLEANEST ORGANIZATIONS
STATEMENTS OF AN UNDEMOCRATIC UNION BEING IN BED WITH MANAGEMENT HURT THIS UNION SAID MR. BIEBER
I RESENT THOSE STATEMENTS
<NOISE> MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OUTSTANDING IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST
ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
<NOISE> MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS
AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN A BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT <NOISE>
ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY

SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN *BOESKY* WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON HUDSON HOWEVER WERE MAD

SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED <NOISE> <NOISE> ITS INVESTMENT *BANKER* TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
<NOISE> MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING <NOISE> WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
<NOISE> A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE *ACQUISITION* WHICH REQUIRES *TIMEPLEX* HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
AT THE MEETING SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO TWENTY MILLION FROM FIFTEEN MILLION
THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY BE USED FOR BENEFIT PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS
THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
THE UNITED STATES OF COURSE HAS A VAST AND IN MANY PLACES EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
THE COUNCIL STUDY PUT A VALUE OF ONE TRILLION DOLLARS ON THE PARTS IT MEASURED
<NOISE> BUT GOVERNMENT OWNED FIXED CAPITAL SUFFERS ALONG WITH PRIVATELY OWNED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WHEN ECONOMIC POLICIES DISCOURAGE LONG TERM INVESTMENT
THE GREATEST SCOURGE OF INVESTMENT IS OF COURSE INFLATION WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUFFERED PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
USER FEES SIMPLY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE SOARING COSTS OF LOANS AND CONSTRUCTION
HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION HAD THE ADDED PROBLEM OF REDUCED YIELDS FROM GASOLINE TAXES BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENERGY SHORTAGES AND SHORTAGE ENFORCED CONSERVATION
THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS TO COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT
THIS IT IS HOPED WILL HELP STOP HIGH INFLATION FROM SPIRALING INTO HYPERINFLATION
THE THINK TANK MEASURED EXPENSE RATIOS WHICH ARE A FUND'S OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS
FOR INVESTORS HIGH RATIOS ARE CLEARLY OF CONCERN
IT CUTS INTO POTENTIAL RETURN EVEN WHEN A FUND IS DOING WELL
AND IT LEAVES A FUND WITH LESS OF A CUSHION IN CASE PERFORMANCE SOURS
ALMOST UNNOTICED IN THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
INSTEAD WHAT SEEMS CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
N. E. C. CORPORATION AS ONE EXAMPLE BEGAN DONATING MONEY TO M. I. T. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
<NOISE> ONE DONATION OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS WENT TO CREATE A C. AND C. SOFTWARE PROFESSORSHIP
C. AND C. IS THE N. E. C. CORPORATE SLOGAN IT STANDS FOR COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
WHILE THE UNITED STATES FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE
THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT UNITED STATES MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT THE CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION

MR. PATTERSON SAYS THE ENGINE COMPANY HAS BACKUP SUPPLIERS
BUT HE ADDS THAT BACKUP IS ALL OFFSHORE
PEOPLE ARE SCARED SAYS RICHARD ROSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN CHICAGO
WHEN THE MARKET GOES DOWN STOP ORDERS APPEAR LIKE CRAZY HE SAYS
AND IN A VOLATILE UNCERTAIN MARKET LIKE THIS INVESTORS USE LIMIT ORDERS TO TRY TO MAKE SHORT TERM GAINS
ATTENDANTS IN SEARCH OF OTHER P. S. TWO CLONES HERE HAVE TO SCOUR CAREFULLY
ACER INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION OF TAIWAN SHOWS A MACHINE BILLED AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE LINE P. S. TWO MODEL THIRTY

MAURICE LIPPENS A CHAIRMAN OF BELGIUM'S GROUPE A. G. WHO TEAMED UP WITH SUEZ FOR THE GENERALE DE *BELGIQUE* STRUGGLE CONCURS
THEY'RE RATHER ALLERGIC TO ALL THAT HE SAYS

IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
AS FOR THE UNITED STATES COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
BUT FRED MCINTYRE A RAILROAD WORKER IN OMAHA NEBRASKA VOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER INVEST IN THE MARKET AGAIN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
WITH GOOD REASON
AS BLACK MONDAY DAWNED HE HELD IN HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT A HANDSOME NEST EGG OF MORE THAN FOUR TIMES HIS THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR PAY
THE NEXT DAY ALL OF IT WAS GONE AND HE OWED HIS BROKER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO BOOT
DAVID MEISTER F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS A HALF DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
HE *DENIED* INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID <NOISE>
HOWEVER HE SAID THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
<NOISE> IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANCE BY INSTANCE CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS

TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELVE
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY BORROWED AND SOLD
STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY

RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND A HALF TO TWENTY ONE
BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
SOURCES SAID AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE THIS MORNING IN TORONTO FOLLOWED BY A NEWS CONFERENCE
BURNS FRY'S ABOUT SEVENTY MEMBER BOARD YESTERDAY WAS PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL BY ITS ELEVEN MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ALREADY HAS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION <NOISE>
SECURITY PACIFIC'S BOARD APPROVED THE TRANSACTION AT A MEETING A FEW DAYS AGO THE SOURCES SAID
THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY A PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
IT POSTED A PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FOR AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
OFF THE HOOK THE RESIGNATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CRIMINAL DIVISION CHIEF WELD ERASES RHODE ISLAND REPRESENTATIVE SAINT GERMAIN'S RISK OF INDICTMENT FOR TAKING MEALS FROM LOBBYISTS
AGENCY LAWYERS WHO RAN A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION URGED NO ACTION CITING HOUSE RULES ALLOWING NEARLY UNLIMITED ENTERTAINMENT
WELD WAS RELUCTANT TO DROP THE CASE
<NOISE> ROBERT RAVITZ A GREY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT SAYS THE AGENCY DID THE BEST IT COULD BASED ON DRAWINGS OF THE COIN
RESPONDING TO MISS JONES'S COMMENTS HE SAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS WITH THE ARTWORK
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME CRUNCH
IF WE HAD LONGER TIME I'M SURE WE COULD HAVE MASSAGED THE ARTWORK TO DEATH
SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING OF THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT ONCE AN UPSCALE PRODUCT PUTS ITS NAME ON LOWER PRICED GOODS IT CAN NEVER GO BACK UP
REVLON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING A LONG SHOT ATTEMPT TO REKINDLE THE HALSTON FLAME
<NOISE> REVLON OWNER OF HALSTON ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED HAS VISIONS OF SEEING HALSTON LABEL CLOTHES BACK IN THE BETTER DRESS DEPARTMENTS
BUT *MARKETERS* BELIEVE THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ITS SIX YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH THE RETAILER J. C. PENNEY COMPANY WHICH ENDED LAST YEAR
BUT WHEN L. B. O. COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM L. B. O.S ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
<NOISE> IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW (BRACE ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ )CLOSE-BRACE COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
THEY'VE ADAPTED
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT IS ALSO THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORP. BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED HOW THE STATE SHOULD GET RID OF ITS HEFTY BUDGET SURPLUS NOW ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION
BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN REGISTERED DEMOCRATS SURVEYED BY THE FIELD INSTITUTE FAVORED GIVING THE MONEY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
BUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE THE MONEY TO BE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS
THAT APPEARS MORE IN LINE WITH REPUBLICAN THINKING
REPUBLICANS ASKED HOW TO DISBURSE THE SURPLUS SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PERSONAL TAX REBATES
HARRY TRUMAN WHISTLE STOPPED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAMPAIGNING AGAINST A PAROCHIAL DO NOTHING CONGRESS THAT WOULD NOT ENACT HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
HE STRUCK A CHORD IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET BUT ALSO DEFEATING SCORES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN THE PROCESS
TRUMAN RECOGNIZED THAT PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS NOT JUST A RACE AMONG CANDIDATES BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE GREAT ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPER SEPARATION OF POWERS
THE CONTEST THEN ISN'T IDEOLOGICAL
IT'S CHARACTER PERSONALITY EXPERIENCE
IT'S CULTURAL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE
PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTY UNDER THE AGREEMENT
IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTY THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS
THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO CANADIAN FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID
TRANSAMERICA SAID ITS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS ACHIEVED RECORD RESULTS IN THE QUARTER WITH CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE GROWING TO TWO POINT FIVE BILLION
ITS LEASING BUSINESS ALSO POSTED RECORD RESULTS
DEMAND FOR STANDARD CONTAINERS WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF STRONG WORLD TRADE TRANSAMERICA SAID
HOWEVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED COMPANY SAID ITS REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS REPORTED LOWER EARNINGS
THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
COULD BE
CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVE THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG *BADLY* IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS *REAWAKENED* THIS CYNICISM
THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAD BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN <NOISE>
NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD IDEA OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
<NOISE> INTERCO SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITS INTERCO SUBSIDIARY INCORPORATED UNIT TERMINATED ITS TENDER OFFER FOR ALL LANE COMMON SHARES AT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
THE OFFER WAS SET TO EXPIRE MONDAY
ANY SHARES TENDERED TO INTERCO UNDER THE OFFER WILL BE RETURNED TO LANE SHAREHOLDERS INTERCO SAID
NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
<NOISE> DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
YEAH SAID MR. *IACOCCA*
MAYBE
MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. *IACOCCA* WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS
EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE SIGNED A NEW FOUR YEAR CONTRACT WITH CHRYSLER
AND IN TUESDAY'S INTERVIEW MR. *IACOCCA* MAINTAINED THAT HE WANTS TO LEAD THE COMPANY INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES
NEITHER THE VOLUNTEER DOCTORS NOR THE SCIENTISTS CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT KNEW WHICH VOLUNTEERS WERE TAKING ACTIVE ASPIRIN AND WHICH WERE TAKING PLACEBOS
HOWEVER A SEPARATE COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO MONITOR THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT AS IT PROCEEDED
IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE THAT IN DECEMBER DECIDED THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE ASPIRIN IN REDUCING HEART ATTACKS WERE SO CLEAR THAT THERE WASN'T ANY NEED TO CONTINUE THE EXPERIMENT
IT'S A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE FACE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY OVERHANG SAYS MORGAN STANLEY'S MR. ROACH
A SLOWING OF GROWTH IN PRODUCTION GIVES COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO WORK OFF SOME INVENTORY
AND ECONOMISTS NOTE THAT THE STEADY OPERATING RATE INDICATES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
THE FOLLOWING DAY MR. LI MARCHED TO CITY HALL HIS AGING PASTRIES IN HAND AND DUMPED THEM ON THE DESK OF THE SURPRISED MAYOR
THE MARKETS ARE FULL OF POOR QUALITY PASTRIES MR. LI PROCLAIMED
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION
AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISK
THE FIRM IS A BIG GOVERNMENT BOND TRADER AND HAS GROWN A LOT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
AND AMONG MORGAN STANLEY'S BIGGEST PERCENTAGE GAINS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS EQUITY PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH NEARLY TRIPLED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION IN REVENUE
IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A DIVE ON THIS ONE HE SAYS
I'M A LITTLE SCARED
I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
JONES INTERCABLE ALSO BOUGHT SEVERAL SYSTEMS SERVING TWELVE THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN AREA
IT MADE THE ACQUISITION ON BEHALF OF JONES CABLE INCOME FUND ONE B. C. VENTURE A JOINT VENTURE OF TWO INTERCABLE MANAGED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
THE PURCHASE WAS FROM OMEGA AFFILIATES
DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER

<NOISE> THE DELAY IS A VICTORY ALBEIT TEMPORARY FOR MR. TRUMP WHO OWNS TWO ATLANTIC CITY CASINO HOTELS
BALLY'S AGREEMENT TO BUY THE GOLDEN NUGGET IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT THE GOLDEN NUGGET PURCHASE BE BLOCKED CAME AS A PART OF A COUNTERSUIT HE FILED AGAINST BALLY IN DECEMBER CHALLENGING A BALLY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN
BALLY HAD EARLIER SUED MR. TRUMP ALLEGING VARIOUS SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
THE OUTLOOK IN THE SENATE IS STILL CLOUDY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CONTINUES TO OPPOSE A TAX BOOST
STILL SENATE BUDGET WRITERS ARE INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THEIR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE
SUCH A BUDGET ITEM WOULD FORCE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO COME UP WITH A TAX INCREASE OF SOME KIND
THE HYUNDAI THAT NIFTY AND CHEAP LITTLE KOREAN CAR HAS CAUGHT ON IN THE U. S. AND NO DOUBT COULD COMPETE IN ANY MARKET IN THE WORLD
SO OUR WILLIAM MCGURN INQUIRED INTO HOW MANY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED <NOISE> FROM KOREA TO JAPAN
HE FOUND THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE NUMBER WAS ZERO
THIS WAS DOWN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN EXPORTS REACHED ONE SOLD TO MITSUBISHI
<NOISE> EXPORTS LOST TO TOUGHER COMPETITION ABROAD AND MORE IMPORTS INTO THE U. S. MARKET HAVE CAUSED MANY FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR TRADITIONAL FAITH IN FREE TRADE
FROM SUGAR LONG PROTECTED TO WHEAT TO FLOWERS FARMERS ARE DEMANDING THAT BORDERS BE CLOSED
THE LOSERS PARTICULARLY IN SUGAR ARE MANY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE DESPERATE ECONOMIES THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS OTHERWISE TRYING TO SALVAGE
TOTAL PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION INCREASED ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST AFTER A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP IN JULY
<NOISE> OUTLAYS FOR PUBLIC BUILDING INCREASED ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER A ONE POINT TWO PERCENT RISE
OVERALL AUGUST OUTLAYS WERE ONE POINT ONE PERCENT ABOVE A YEAR EARLIER
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
THE JOURNAL CAN NEVER BE ALL THINGS TO ALL READERS
<NOISE> IT DOESN'T TRY TO BE
WE ARE NOT PLANNING SPORTS SECTIONS OR LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE COLORED WEATHER MAPS OR STORIES ON EVERY MINOR CRISIS IN THE WORLD
WE DO INTEND TO REMAIN AMERICA'S NATIONAL BUSINESS DAILY <NOISE> AND WITH OUR EXPANDING ASIAN AND EUROPEAN EDITIONS THE GLOBAL BUSINESS DAILY AS WELL
THAT MEANS FOCUSING FIRMLY ON NEWS THAT BUSY BUSINESS PEOPLE TRULY NEED
STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
<NOISE> FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
MR. PEROT TOLD TEXAS OFFICIALS LAST MONTH THAT HIS NEW COMPANY WOULD BID AGAINST E. D. S. TO PROCESS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR IN MEDICAID CLAIMS
THUS MR. PEROT PUT INTO PLAY A CONTRACT THAT E. D. S. HAS HELD EXCLUSIVELY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
<NOISE> THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR
THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
N. B. C.'S T. V. COVERAGE ALSO GETS ITS SHARE OF THE BLAME
MARKETERS SAY IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE FOR EXCITEMENT TO BUILD
THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS WHICH LED TO RATINGS THAT WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED DIDN'T HELP EITHER
THE REHABILITATION PROCESS IS CERTAINLY FURTHER ALONG
THERE'S LESS LOOKING BACK AND MORE LOOKING FORWARD NOW MR. LEFEVRE SAID
PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING MORE ON THE ELECTION AND THE POST ELECTION PERIOD WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY
ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED <NOISE> WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY

BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
<NOISE> I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
ANY SUCH AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AIRLINES AND AIRPORT OPERATORS COULD BE WRITTEN INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REAUTHORIZING THE AVIATION TRUST FUND
THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS FINANCED BY TICKET AND FUEL TAXES HELPS PAY FOR F. A. A. OPERATIONS <NOISE> AND PROVIDES GRANTS TO AIRPORTS
SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AIRPORT OPERATORS AS A CONDITION OF ACCEPTING THE GRANTS AGREE TO GIVE UP SOME AUTHORITY IN MAKING NOISE RULES
RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT IS FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY S- CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
TANDY MADE THE INFORMAL PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT AT A REGULAR GATHERING OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS COMPUTER USERS <NOISE> AT THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS
THE COMPANY ALSO SAID IT WOULD INTRODUCE ITS FIRST LASER PRINTER THIS YEAR
THE HIGH QUALITY PRINTERS ARE BECOMING A MUST COMPUTING ACCESSORY FOR BUSINESSES
FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS <NOISE> ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME
BUT REALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING
THERE'S BEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN SHORT TERM SENTIMENT SAID THOMAS G. GIBBON A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC.
FOR WEEKS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRADING BEARISHLY ON DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND A RISE IN THE C. R. B. INDEX

PAKISTAN HAS PROPOSED VARIOUS NON PROLIFERATION CONTROLS ON ITS OWN PROGRAM BUT ONLY IF INDIA AGREES TO THE SAME CONTROLS
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU

THE EGYPTIANS WERE UNHAPPY WITH MANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PARTICIPATION BUT NEVERTHELESS OPTED FOR THE M. ONE OVER ALTERNATIVES FROM BRITAIN FRANCE AND BRAZIL
THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THAT THEY COULD USE OUR GRANTS TO BUY IN SAID AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
IT'S NOT GOING TO COST THEM A THING
HIS INABILITY TO RECOVER FROM OCTOBER'S MARKET PLUNGE WAS TRACED TO A HOSTILE BID FROM TWO RIVAL FINANCIERS FOR BELL RESOURCES LIMITED WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY BELL GROUP
THE BID FORCED MR. HOLMES A COURT TO CALL OFF A PROPOSED MERGER OF THE BELL COMPANIES

WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
LAST YEAR SPONSORS OF A STRONG ACID RAIN BILL CLAIMED TO HAVE A TENTATIVE ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR OF THEIR BILL

THESE TRENDS HE SAID ARE REDRESSING THE TRADE IMBALANCES THAT HELPED PROVOKE THE DOLLAR'S FALL
I DON'T WANT TO BE EUPHORIC YOU KNOW BUT I THINK IT'S UNDER WAY
MR. POEHL ADDED
IN KEY DAIRY STATES MILK PRODUCTION ROSE SHARPLY DURING THE PROGRAM
IN CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION INCREASED TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND SIX POINT NINE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
IN TEXAS IT WAS UP THREE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
BANKAMERICA OFFICIALS HOPE THAT LIKE THE EARLIER PROBLEMS THEIR IMPROVING FINANCES WILL FEED ON THEMSELVES
IT IS COUNTING ON A STRONGER CREDIT RATING TO ALLOW IT TO BECOME MORE THAN A MINOR LEAGUER IN PITCHING LUCRATIVE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS
MONEY TO PROMOTE A FLAGGING GLOBAL CORPORATE COMPUTER SERVICE IS BECOMING AVAILABLE
-SO IS SUPPORT FOR A BEEFED UP TEAM OF DEAL MAKERS TO BROKER MERGERS AMONG CALIFORNIA COMPANIES-
NONE OF THESE AREAS HOWEVER HOLD THE PROSPECT OF QUICK GROWTH
PRICES OF SOME ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR BONDS ROSE A QUARTER POINT OR TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR EACH THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT

AIRLINES SAY AIRSPACE HAS BECOME SO CROWDED IN EUROPE THAT ANY AIRLINE MISSING AN ASSIGNED TAKEOFF SLOT MAY HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR FOR ANOTHER FREE SLOT
<NOISE> EACH COUNTRY IN EUROPE ALSO OPERATES ITS OWN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM AND THIS MAKES THE ENTIRE EUROPEAN AIR SYSTEM VULNERABLE TO THE CONTINENT'S FREQUENT AIR CONTROLLER STRIKES
TWO WEEKS AGO FOR INSTANCE A WEEKEND STRIKE BY ENGINEERS WHO CONTROL AIRPLANES IN FLIGHT OVER FRANCE CAUSED HORRENDOUS BACKUPS ON BRITISH FLIGHTS HEADED THROUGH FRENCH AIRSPACE

THE AVAILABLE SOVIET INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE ITS NORTH SEA NAVY ITS MOBILE ARMORED FORCES IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND ITS ARRAY OF CONVENTIONALLY ARMED TACTICAL MISSILES

STANDA HAS IMPRESSIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS BUT LACKLUSTER EARNINGS ON AN OPERATING LEVEL ACCORDING TO ONE FINANCIAL ANALYST
CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID

MR. PETERS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD WAS FIRED LAST JANUARY IN A MANAGEMENT DISPUTE AFTER THIRTY YEARS WITH J. W. T.
HE PLANNED TO START A COMPANY TO IMPORT HANDMADE GOODS FROM EUROPE
HE ALSO LOOKED FORWARD TO EXPANDING THE TINY CHARTER AIRCRAFT CONCERN THAT HAD BEEN HIS HOBBY FOR YEARS
THEN LAST FEBRUARY HE WAS CONTACTED BY MARTIN SORRELL CHAIRMAN OF W. P. P. THE BRITISH MARKETING SERVICES CONCERN
<NOISE> WHAT REMAINS FOR HISTORY TO JUDGE IS FIRST HOW WELL HE SUCCEEDED
HERE THE JUDGMENT MAY BE MIXED
WE DO HAVE LESS TAXES AND LESS INFLATION BUT BIGGER SPENDING AND AS MUCH GOVERNMENT AS BEFORE
<NOISE> HISTORY'S SECOND JUDGMENT WILL BE WHETHER HIS YEARS REPRESENT A MERE PASSING CHANGE OR WHETHER THE CHANGE WILL ENDURE
WE CANNOT SAY TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT COMES HEREAFTER AND WHAT COMES HEREAFTER WILL DECIDE MR. REAGAN'S PLACE AMONG OUR PRESIDENTS

UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BLACK AND DECKER HAS COUNTERED AMERICAN STANDARD'S RIGHTS PLAN BY SEEKING SHAREHOLDERS' CONSENT TO TAKE CONTROL OF AMERICAN STANDARD'S BOARD

FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORPORATION A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFER
HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
INTEREST RATES WERE MIXED ON NEW SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REGULAR WEEKLY AUCTION YESTERDAY
THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW THIRTEEN WEEK TREASURY BILLS ROSE TO FIVE POINT EIGHT ONE PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT AT LAST WEEK'S SALE
THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW TWENTY SIX WEEK BILLS FELL TO SIX POINT ONE PERCENT FROM SIX POINT ONE EIGHT PERCENT THE PREVIOUS WEEK
JUNE'S LOAD FACTOR OR PERCENTAGE OF SEATS FILLED TOTALED SIXTY FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT RANKING CONTINENTAL NEAR THE BOTTOM OF MAJOR U. S. AIRLINES
THE FIGURE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAY'S LOW LEVEL OF SIXTY POINT ONE PERCENT BUT TRAILED THE SIXTY FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF A YEAR EARLIER
FOR THE MONTH CONTINENTAL FLEW THREE POINT THREE BILLION REVENUE PASSENGER MILES A NINETY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION MILES A YEAR EARLIER
A REVENUE PASSENGER MILE IS ONE PAYING PASSENGER FLOWN ONE MILE
THE INCREASE REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION WITH PEOPLE EXPRESS
THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET IS AWASH WITH LIQUIDITY MR. GRANT SAYS
BUT IN JUNE SUDDENLY WITH NO APPARENT DRAINAGE IT WENT DOWN AND KEPT GOING DOWN HE SAYS
WHAT IS A MYSTERY TO MR. GRANT AND MANY OTHERS IS THAT THE TOKYO MARKET HAS SINCE STAGED A VIGOROUS REBOUND
A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS
THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS ZERO POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES
THE NOTES ARE RATED DOUBLE A. THREE BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED AND DOUBLE A. MINUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION
IF ITS MAVERICK STRATEGY WORKS SECURITY PACIFIC WILL BE SHOWING ANOTHER WAY BESIDES ACQUISITIONS FOR SUPERREGIONAL BANKS TO GROW
THESE BANKS' MANAGERS INCLUDING MR. FLAMSON PLAN TO EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE THE BIG NEW YORK BANKS AS NATIONAL GIANTS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
BOLSTERED BY STRONG EQUITY CAPITAL POSITIONS SUPERREGIONALS ALREADY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN MONEY CENTER INSTITUTIONS
PASSAGE OF THE KENNEDY MARKEY BILL OR SIMILAR GRANTS OF MORAL RIGHTS WOULD ENRICH ESTABLISHED ARTISTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR STRUGGLING COMPETITORS
IN ADDITION THE THEORY OF MORAL RIGHTS IS BOTH PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTENABLE AND AN INVITATION TO AN ORGY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL CONFUSION
CONGRESS SHOULD REFUSE TO GRANT ARTISTS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND SHOULD REFUSE TO SIGN THE BERN CONVENTION
THEY CLASSIFIED EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY AS RACIST OR SEXIST SAYS MR. SCHAUB
WHERE'S THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY
BEATS US
BUT IF YOU FIND A COLLEGE ADMINISTRATOR WHO ISN'T COWERING FROM THE NEW ORTHODOXY LET US KNOW
SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
BY CONTRACTING OUT PRODUCTION TO AMERICAN PLANTS THEY ARE SAVING MORE THAN A DIME PER CAN OF DRINK
THEIR NEXT LOGICAL STEP ANALYSTS SAY WILL BE TO ACQUIRE U. S. SOFT DRINK CONCERNS
EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT EVEN BREAK INTO THE ENORMOUS U. S. MARKET
AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
THE PLOT IS A TRUE LIFE TALE OF M. C. A. ITSELF AND THE ENDING HAS YET TO BE PLAYED OUT
BUT THE REVELATIONS HAVE ALREADY RAISED EYEBROWS IN HOLLYWOOD WHERE M. C. A. IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE BEDROCK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
M. C. A. HAD TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE LAST YEAR OWNS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND IS A TELEVISION MUSIC AND REAL ESTATE GIANT
THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY WRONGDOING BUT RECENT PUBLICITY ABOUT ITS TANGLE OF BUSINESS DEALINGS THREATENS AT THE VERY LEAST TO SULLY ITS REPUTATION
EDUCATION IS THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH STUDYING A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS TO GAIN INFORMATION AND THE DEXTERITY TO USE YOUR WITS AND YOUR EXPRESSION
EDUCATION PREPARES YOU TO BE SOMEONE MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING

MOST UNUSUALLY THIS TIME AROUND THE CYCLICAL CLIMB IN PLANT USAGE HASN'T YET OCCURRED
AS THE EXPANSION KEEPS ROLLING HOWEVER THIS IS EXPECTED TO COME
WHEN IT DOES FORECASTERS LOOK FOR BRISKER CAPITAL SPENDING AS WELL REGARDLESS OF THE NEW TAX RULES
IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SPOKESMAN
STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
<NOISE> BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF THE TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIKELY
THE SINGAPORE ECONOMY AFTER ITS FIRST DOWNTURN IN NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IS ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ANALYSTS SAY
AFTER CONTRACTING ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE ISLAND'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GREW ONE POINT NINE PERCENT LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INITIAL ESTIMATES
EXPANSION OF THREE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT IS PREDICTED FOR THIS YEAR
THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER
TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT OVER SALARIES THEY PUT HER FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR ANNUAL INCOME IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND LIVE OFF HIS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME
I LOOK AT IT AS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE MADE TOGETHER SAYS MR. STEPHENS
BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISKS PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING
NO LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS CAN MAKE A NUCLEAR FACILITY SAFE UNLESS IT HAS GOOD MANAGEMENT THE N. R. C. TOLD CONGRESS LAST YEAR
INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS
IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF ITS PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS
UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
ARE THE DANES SUPPOSED TO LISTEN SERIOUSLY TO SECRETARY SHULTZ WHEN HE TELLS THEM THAT THE PROPOSED DANISH POLICY TOWARD SHIPS UNDERCUTS THE NUCLEAR DETERRENCE OF NATO
WASN'T MR. SHULTZ JUST IN MOSCOW WORKING ON YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR TREATY
HAVEN'T AMERICAN DIPLOMATS AT NATO BEEN TELLING EVERYONE THAT COMPARED WITH THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF NOT RATIFYING THE TREATY THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF RATIFICATION WOULD BE MINIMAL
MANY FUND MANAGERS HERE SAY AMERICA ISN'T TAKING THE STRONG MEDICINE NEEDED TO CURB HIGH CONSUMER SPENDING IMPROVE LOW PERSONAL SAVINGS RATES AND COMBAT THE STUBBORN DUAL DEFICITS
THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY PROGRESS BEFORE THE NEW U. S. PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR AND SAY BOTH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES WILL PROBABLY RISE
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION
MR. KAVNER SAID THE RIVAL GROUP LACKS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DIFFERENCES
IN ADDITION HE SAID A. T. AND T. SPENDS FAR MORE EACH YEAR ON DEVELOPING UNIX THAN THE OPEN SOFTWARE FOUNDATION HAS INDICATED IT WILL SPEND
HE ADDED THAT A. T. AND T. PLANS TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS UNIX ANY USEFUL FEATURES FROM ITS RIVALS' VERSION
AND MR. WATT IS ECSTATIC
YOU CAN TEACH WHOLE HISTORY LESSONS FROM THIS VILLAGE INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE SOCIOLOGY AND ART HE SAYS
THESE WEALTHY LANDLORDS GOT BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL AND THAT LED TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE HAN EMPIRE
THE OWNERS BECAME POWERFUL LORDS AND THE GUARDS IN THE TOWERS BECAME PRIVATE ARMIES
RICK BRIGGS PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID FALCONBRIDGE'S LATEST PROPOSALS ON *CONTRACTING* OUT ARE NOT ENCOURAGING
THE PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED YESTERDAY AFTER A TWO DAY RECESS IN THE TALKS
ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF FALCONBRIDGE'S NICKEL OUTPUT COMES FROM ITS SUDBURY OPERATIONS
DETAILS ARE STILL MURKY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CREDITS
ITALIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT ROME'S DECISION TO GRANT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GUARANTEE OF EXPORT CREDITS WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A BANKING DECISION
BRITAIN'S MIDLAND BANK HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A NUMBER ONE BILLION CREDIT LINE THOUGH SOME BRITISH BANKS MAY BE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT PARTICIPATING
FRENCH BANKS HAVE YET TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS OFFICIALLY BUT ARE SAID TO BE CONSIDERING LOANS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS
THE FED REPORT GAVE NO HINT THAT MAKERS OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT EXPECT DEMAND FOR THEIR WARES TO FALL OFF
PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT THOUGH REDUCED BY THE DROP IN AUTO AND TRUCK PRODUCTION GREW ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT IN JULY AFTER REMAINING FLAT IN JUNE
THE FED ATTRIBUTED THE INCREASE TO STEPPED UP PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND FACTORY EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT
OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ALSO REBOUNDED IN JULY AFTER DROPPING FOR TWO MONTHS
IT'S KIND OF LIKE EATING PEANUTS ISN'T IT SAID MR. MURPHY
ONCE YOU START IT'S TOUGH TO STOP
THE UMPTEENTH SOUNDS OF LEAD SMACKING METAL AND A RIFLE BEING COCKED SERVED AS A QUICK ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
WITH THE SPEAKER BEHIND IT GEPHARDT WILL PASS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR SAID REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PEASE DEMOCRAT FOR OHIO
ADDED REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DONNELLY DEMOCRAT FOR MASSACHUSETTS ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE
HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY UNLESS HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A PROVISION LIKE GEPHARDT
ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
IF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
THE UNION SAID THE ENGINEERS WERE LEAVING THEIR VESSELS WHEN THEY DOCKED
LATE YESTERDAY NINETEEN SHIPS WERE REPORTED TO BE TIED UP BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE
THE UNION WHICH REPRESENTS ENGINEERS ON ABOUT EIGHTY GREAT LAKES SHIPS HAS BEEN WITHOUT A CONTRACT SINCE MAY THIRTY FIRST
THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE ANALYSTS
IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
AS OF APRIL FIRST ALL INTEREST INCOME WILL BE TAXED AT TWENTY PERCENT
EXEMPTIONS INCLUDE SINGLE MOTHERS THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD
OTHER EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING AND PENSIONS
THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
IT'S TRUE AS A *METAPHOR* FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
MR. HOWARD NOT ONLY HELPED THE FLEDGLING PUBLIC COMPANIES DRUM UP INTEREST IN THEIR SHARES HE HELPED INVEST THE CAPITAL THEY RAISED IN THE PUBLIC OFFERINGS
IN MANY CASES THE BANKS HE ADVISED INVESTED LARGE AMOUNTS IN EACH OTHER
AND THEY LENT FUNDS TO OTHER CLIENTS OF MR. HOWARD WHO SOMETIMES INVESTED IN THE SAME STOCKS
<NOISE> ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC HURT THE CHAIN
THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
HOWEVER FRIENDLY'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRETAX OPERATING PROFIT OF FORTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BURMESE MARCHED IN RANGOON AND FOURTEEN OTHER CITIES TO PROTEST THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW LEADER SEIN LWIN

WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMIT ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
<NOISE> CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS
SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE SWANSON COMPANY BEGAN SELLING FROZEN POT PIES TURKEY CHICKEN AND MEAT
THE FIRST PRODUCTION ORDER CALLED FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PIES
SOON IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY
BY NINETEEN FIFTY THREE CLARKE AND HIS BROTHER WERE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP COMPLETE FROZEN DINNERS
THOUSANDS OF AZERBAIJAN WORKERS RALLIED IN THE SOVIET REPUBLIC'S CAPITAL BAKU AFTER A DAY OF WORK STOPPAGES TO BACK DEMANDS FOR GREATER LOCAL AUTONOMY
IN ESTONIA THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF URGED ETHNIC RUSSIAN WORKERS TO END A SIX DAY STRIKE OVER A NEW LAW TIGHTENING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
<NOISE> FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED THE DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFICE
HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
<NOISE> MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS ARE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE F- REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED
IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
<NOISE> BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED
AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
CONGRESS'S JOINT TAX COMMITTEE NOW IS WITHOUT A STAFF CHIEF
DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICES OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
HIS SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
<NOISE> BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OF A TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. *CORPORATION*
THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAYS BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
AND HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENTED SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
THE RECURRING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HANDS ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
<NOISE> GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
<NOISE> THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
<NOISE> THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
<NOISE> INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
<NOISE> HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED ON IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
<NOISE> THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY
FRANK PEREZ A RETIRED DIPLOMAT RECALLS THE DAY HE LEFT FOR A TWO YEAR STINT ON THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN TURKEY
FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAYS SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS SOGGY AND MOLDY
WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
GENLYTE DESIGNS AND MAKES LIGHTING FIXTURES AND ELECTRONIC LIGHTING CONTROLS
OTHER BAIRNCO UNITS MAKE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING SYSTEMS
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NEW YORK BASED BAIRNCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION OR TWO DOLLARS AND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE
THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
<NOISE> TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
ONCE A SOFTWARE INDUSTRY STAR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN BUFFETED BY GROWING COMPETITION IN ITS CORE DATABASE BUSINESS
LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
<NOISE> IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY THAT COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION OF DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR
SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL

CHEMLAWN IS DISCUSSED ONLY BRIEFLY AND IS RULED OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET BY MR. BUNTROCK
OFFICIALS AT THE COMPANY SAY CHEMLAWN DIDN'T BELONG ON THE AGENDA UNDER PENDING ACQUISITIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE
<NOISE> I DON'T KNOW IF JESSE JACKSON EVER DREAMED OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE GROWING UP POOR AND BLACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA
I DO KNOW HE NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE EASY OR QUICK
I HOPE MR. JACKSON WILL FORGIVE ME IF I ASSUME THAT HE IS WILLING TO WAIT ANOTHER EIGHT WHILE KEEPING HIS EYES ON THE PRIZE
SOUTHWESTERN BELL HAS THIRTY DAYS TO CONTEST THE COMPLAINT
THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A FINAL DECISION BY THE END OF THE YEAR
<NOISE> GENERALLY THOUGH THE AGENCY'S STAFF IS VIEWED AS AGGRESSIVE IN ITS RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMISSION HAS USUALLY APPROVED FAR MORE MODEST CUTS FOR REGULATED COMPANIES
WE HAVE FREEDOM IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IT STINKS SAYS ELEVEN YEAR OLD SEAN HOOKS
DRUGS ALCOHOL CRIME
THERE'S NO GOOD NEWS ANYMORE
I'M HOPING WE GET A PRESIDENT WHO CLEANS OUT AMERICA
DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COSTS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
<NOISE> KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE L- LIENS
LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
A JUDGE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELFTH
AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLAR PLUS PER TON PROFIT
TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS
WE'LL TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE JUST WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. /SLASH E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDING CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
ON THE SURFACE THE TRADE REPORT LOOKED ENCOURAGING
THE NATION'S SEASONALLY ADJUSTED TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED TO EIGHT POINT SEVENTEEN BILLION IN JUNE THE LOWEST MONTHLY DEFICIT SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT OH TWO BILLION FROM THE TEN POINT TWENTY FOUR BILLION ORIGINALLY REPORTED
SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SUGGEST IRAN IS THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZING TERRORIST STRIKES AGAINST AMERICAN WEST EUROPEAN AND ARAB TARGETS
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALERTED EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES OF AN INCREASED THREAT
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY INTELLIGENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT IRAN HAS LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR TERRORISM IN THE UNITED STATES
WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDE(R)- UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
HOWEVER THE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING
THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND THE FURTHER AMOUNT REQUIRED IS EXPECTED TO FLOW FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE OVERSEAS REINSURANCE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE
TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
THIRTY ONE TEAMS OF NINETEEN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND ASSORTED OTHER GROUPS SIGNED UP FOR THE FIRST LOCAL COMPETITION
FOR WEEKS DRUMS WERE HEARD ALONG THE WILLAMETTE AS THE TEAMS PRACTICED
BOATS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN IN BUSINESS SUITS FRESH FROM WORK OR HAPPY HOUR WERE NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT
THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDWARD VERSUS
MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
OGILVY IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BILLINGS OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION
ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE BILLINGS COME FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MR. ROMAN SAID
AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A FOURTH WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. V. SPOKESMAN SAID
THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT STILL IS CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOWING GROWTH
FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM
MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS
HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS *STYMIED* BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN A. S. E. A. N. POWERS
SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THE SWISS FRANC BOND MARKET MEANWHILE REMAINED LISTLESS DESPITE A SHARP FALL IN THE DOLLAR
MOST PRICES WERE UNCHANGED WITH AVERAGE TURNOVER TRADERS SAID
ONE GENEVA TRADER SAID INVESTORS WERE STAYING OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS IN THE DOLLAR'S CURRENT DECLINE
CLOSELY HELD TRANSAMERICAN SAID IT ALSO AGREED TO SETTLE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER CREDITOR MEDALLION OIL COMPANY
THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WOULD REMOVE TWO MAJOR HURDLES IN TRANSAMERICAN'S LONG STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS
TRANSAMERICAN FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT
I RECEIVED WELFARE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN
LUCKILY I WAS ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY TO GET A GOOD JOB AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
<NOISE> THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
EL SALVADOR'S DUARTE TRAVELED TO THE U. S. FOR TREATMENT OF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A MALIGNANT STOMACH DISEASE
THE PRESIDENT HAS R- BEEN RUMORED TO HAVE CANCER
A SPOKESMAN SAID TESTS WOULD BE CONDUCTED AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER IN WASHINGTON
HOW SERIOUS AND PATIENT INVESTOR INTEREST IS WILL BE TESTED NEXT MONTH
A GOVERNMENT OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY IS SET TO AUCTION OFF THE HYATT REGENCY MANILA
THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
THUS INSTEAD OF CALMAT'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT <NOISE>
MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER AT ALL THIS WEEK
THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR AND HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION T- SHARES OUTSTANDING
THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
A SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
DESPITE I- ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
A DIRECTOR SAID THE *BOARD* LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
THE E. P. A. PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR MUNICIPAL TRASH DUMPS THAT THE AGENCY ESTIMATED WILL COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD A- REQUIRE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DUMPS TO INSTALL GROUNDWATER MONITORING SYSTEMS
THEY WOULD ALSO CLOSE SOME DUMPS AND PUT SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON OTHERS IN CERTAIN AREAS
HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS
THE ORDERS TYPICALLY BAR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF RECORDS AND DEPOSITIONS EVEN AFTER A SETTLEMENT OR VERDICT
PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS GENERALLY HAVEN'T BALKED AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PREPARE FOR THEIR TRIALS
RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
ANSWER YES WITHOUT QUESTION
IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
<NOISE> YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS MR. WU SAID
TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE
SPOKESWOMAN FOR ASHLAND SAID WE HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT
COMPANY OFFICIALS NOTIFIED FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TWO YEARS AGO THAT THE IRANIANS HAD ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION
ASHLAND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN OF MR. ATKINS'S INVOLVEMENT THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
THE WORD IS TERROR
MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
BUT SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL *ABOUT* S. H. V.'S INTENTIONS
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SAID HUMPHREY HARRISON AN ANALYST AT COUNTY SECURITIES
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE END GAME IS BUT I DOUBT THEY S. H. V. WILL REMAIN AT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT
MR. REINHARD REMEMBERS AN INDIAN COMMERCIAL TWO YEARS AGO AT THE PRESTIGIOUS CANNES FESTIVAL NO RELATION TO THE FILM FESTIVAL THERE
IT SHOWED A CLOSE UP OF A FLATULENT ELEPHANT'S BACKSIDE WHILE THE ANNOUNCER EXPLAINED THE SOUND IN PLAIN LANGUAGE
THE COMMERCIAL PLUGGED AN ANTACID FOR HUMANS
IT DIDN'T WIN
TEXACO FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN PROTECTION CITING THE BURDEN OF ITS TEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR LEGAL BATTLE WITH PENNZOIL
THE BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE THE LARGEST IN HISTORY CAME AFTER BOTH FIRMS APPARENTLY REMAINED ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS APART IN SETTLEMENT TALKS
THOUGH THE FILING COMPLICATES THE BATTLE MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE NEITHER COMPANY WILL EMERGE THE WINNER
BUT THE OIL WORKERS HAD A CANDIDATE TOO AND AS THE PRIMARY DREW NEAR STRANGE THINGS STARTED HAPPENING IN EBANO
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH TAP WATER SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES CUT OFF
PHONES RANG WITH DEATH THREATS
THE WORLD IS MADE UP OF OPTIMISTS AND PESSIMISTS SAYS MR. STONE
IN THIS INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE THEY'RE MOSTLY PESSIMISTS
I MAY BE THE LAST OPTIMIST BUT I'M SURE I'M RIGHT
LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST
ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATER THIS WEEK
BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
<NOISE> IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
THE PRODUCT IS A LEGITIMATE HEDGING PRODUCT AND A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD *LIQUIDITY* TO THE MARKET
REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID INTENSE FRICTION BETWEEN SALVATORE RANIERI AND MR. DAVIS DEVELOPED DURING THE KIAWAH NEGOTIATIONS
SALVATORE RANIERI DIDN'T RETURN A REPORTER'S TELEPHONE CALL
A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. DAVIS DIDN'T DISPUTE THE REPORT OF PERSONAL FRICTION
BANKS THAT COMMIT TO THE NEW CREDIT BY TODAY GET A FEE EQUAL TO POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THEY COMMIT
IT WON'T BE CLEAR UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND HOW MANY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED

MR. LENNANE HAD STARTED THE BIDDING IN JUNE BY PROPOSING TO TAKE THE COMPANY PRIVATE FOR SEVEN DOLLARS TWENTY FIVE A SHARE

BEING ENGLISH AND A WORKING CLASS NORTH LONDONER AT THAT IS A BIG PART OF MISS FOX'S APPEAL IN BRITAIN WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS STILL COUNT
THERE'S NOTHING PATRICIAN ABOUT HER LOOKS WHICH SUITS HER FANS HERE JUST FINE

NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
NEARLY ALL THE GAINERS WERE COMPANIES THAT SELL TO CUSTOMERS OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS
INTEL THE BIGGEST O. T. C. SEMICONDUCTOR MAKER AND BY FAR THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS ISSUE ON NASDAQ FELL ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY THREE AND THREE QUARTERS

MARKET PARTICIPANTS SAY THE DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T BOTHER THEM
WE GO THROUGH THESE CYCLES SAYS JOHN WATSON PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY TRADERS ASSOCIATION MOST OF WHOSE MEMBERS ARE O. T. C. BROKERS
THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES CONDUCIVE TO BRINGING OUT NEW OFFERINGS
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BAFFLING CASE OF A YOUNG CHILD WHO SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
DOCTORS COULDN'T IDENTIFY A MEDICAL REASON
THE TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS HERE STRESS
SENSING THE FAMILY AS WHOLE UNDER PRESSURE THE CHILD HAS BECOME AN EMOTIONAL CARETAKER TO THE PARENTS

OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
TODAY COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE STOOD UP OVERTLY TO THE COCAINE GANGS REMAIN A MINORITY
NOTABLE AMONG THEM IS JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF
SHE HAS INTENSIFIED THE BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS DESPITE THEIR THREAT OF TOTAL WAR AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IF THE CURRENT NARCOTICS CONTROL DRIVE CONTINUES
LIKE MS. DE GREIFF SOME JUDGES HAVE DEFIED THE GANGSTERS
MORE THAN A DOZEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FUNCTIONARIES HAVE BEEN KILLED THIS YEAR
THEY INCLUDE HELENA DIAZ THE MEDELLIN JUDGE WHO IN JULY REFUSED TO REVOKE ARREST WARRANTS ISSUED FOR REPUTED MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSSES
THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
THE BUNDESBANK HAS REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION
THESE DAYS IT'S POSSIBLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERS AND READ ABOUT WEST GERMAN FEARS OF REIGNITING INFLATION
YOU HAVE TO PINCH YOURSELF TO REMEMBER THAT THE INFLATION RUNNING NEAR ZERO IN APRIL IS NOW RUNNING BELOW ZERO
THE E. M. S. APPARENTLY MUST NOW BE REALIGNED AND THE FRANC DEVALUED TO ACCOMMODATE THE GERMAN TASTE FOR DEFLATION
BUT THE TRADE FIGURES CAN BE AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON INTEREST RATES MANY ANALYSTS SAY
IF THE JANUARY DEFICIT TURNS OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GAP THAT MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE DOLLAR MIGHT RESUME ITS FALL
THAT COULD ALARM FOREIGN INVESTORS AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM ADDING TO THEIR HOLDINGS OF DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS
THERE'S BEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN SHORT TERM SENTIMENT SAID THOMAS G. GRIBBON A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED
FOR WEEKS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRADING BEARISHLY ON DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND A RISE IN THE C. R. B. INDEX
DESPITE THE REVERSAL INVESTORS STILL ARE TAKING A CAUTIOUS STANCE AND USING THE LATEST RALLY AS A SELLING OPPORTUNITY HE ADDED
AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
MR. MECHEM WHO HELD LITTLE TAFT STOCK HAD NEVER BEEN AN AGGRESSIVE CHAIRMAN
BUT HE HAD HIS OWN LONG HIDDEN AGENDA FOR THE COMPANY AND IT BORE A SURPRISING SIMILARITY TO WHAT THE BASS TEAM WANTED
IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. MECHEM INVITED FOUR BASS REPRESENTATIVES ONTO THE TAFT BOARD AND THE BASS TEAM BEGAN TO ENGINEER A REORGANIZATION
SOURCES SAID THAT IN THE CONTRACT TALKS BEING HELD IN LONDON IRAQI MARKETING OFFICIALS ARE INSISTING THAT TWO MAJOR OIL COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE SIGNED
BUT U. S. MAJORS KNOWN TO BE IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS DENIED SIGNING CONTRACTS OR DECLINED TO COMMENT
WE DON'T SEE ANY JOY IN THIS FOR A U. S. REFINER YET SAID A SUPPLY OFFICIAL FOR ONE U. S. MAJOR
IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL

THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT

IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR
AS A RESULT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING
AND THAT COULD LEAD THE FED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES IN AN EFFORT TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY IN THE COMING MONTHS
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES

WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED A CLINICAL PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT SO FAR SAYS SAMUEL BRODER DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY AT THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
IF WE DO I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE SCIENTISTS AT GENENTECH CAN FIX IT

THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
AT W. F. I. A. RUNNING THE FORMULA LAST JANUARY THIRTIETH MEANT BUYING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF REEBOK QUICKLY

THOSE HOLDINGS RANGE FROM MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF I. B. M. TO JUST SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ALLIS CHALMERS CORPORATION

AFTER ALL HE ISN'T THE ONE WHO HAS TO RISK GETTING HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A METAL PIPE
PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER

THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
IF DOCTOR HAMMER WERE TO DIE TOMORROW THE CHECK TO HIS FOUNDATION WOULD BE MORE THAN NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS
BUT OCCIDENTAL AND DOCTOR HAMMER APPARENTLY DON'T FORESEE AN IMMEDIATE USE OF THE CLAUSE THAT WILL BENEFIT THE FOUNDATION
THE CHAIRMAN'S EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT RUNS AT LEAST TO FEBRUARY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AT WHICH TIME DOCTOR HAMMER WILL BE NINETY NINE
AFTER THAT THE CONTRACT AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDS INDEFINITELY

CHILE A PROTECTIONIST BACKWATER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES NOW HAS A DYNAMIC AND OPEN EXPORT CAPABLE ECONOMY

THE CRACK EPIDEMIC HAS JUST ABOUT SILENCED LIBERAL OPPOSITION TO TOUGH LAW AND ORDER POLICIES
IT IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS TO TALK ABOUT REHABILITATING AN UZI TOTING DRUG PUSHER WHO MAKES FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK
HIS PROBLEM IS NOT LACK OF SELF ESTEEM
THERE IS NOTHING A SOCIAL WORKER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SOCIAL WORKER IS TOO AFRAID TO VENTURE INTO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD

HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
BUT FOR MOST MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS THE TAX BITE THIS YEAR WILL BE BIGGER THAN EVER
HOLDERS ARE TAXED ON A HUNDRED PERCENT OF REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS UNDER THE NEW TAX LAW FOR INSTANCE

MACY IS OFFERING SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS A SHARE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF FEDERATED'S SHARES PLUS STOCK IN A COMBINED FEDERATED MACY FOR THE REMAINDER
THE STOCK COMPONENT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL BID WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY ESTIMATED AT ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
MACY'S ADVISERS HOWEVER PRIVATELY VALUE IT AT BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS A SHARE OR COMPARABLE TO CAMPEAU'S PROPOSAL

I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD HYMAN OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INCORPORATED SAYS
REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS USUALLY IS WRONG
THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE

ALL THE GAINS THAT WE'RE MAKING ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SAYS F. JAMES MCDONALD G. M.'S PRESIDENT
THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAPPENING IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. TODAY
INDEED THE ERA OF BIG TIME NATIONAL LABOR TALKS IN WHICH UNION AND MANAGEMENT LEADERS BUTT HEADS OVER PENNIES AN HOUR IS WANING
EVEN LESS APPRECIATED IS THE TURMOIL THAT OFTEN RESULTS FOR WOMEN
"QUOTE WHEN HE STARTED BECOMING IMPOTENT I HAD ALL KINDS OF WORRIES AND STRANGE THOUGHTS "UNQUOTE SAYS MAGGIE A BOSTON WOMAN WHO LIVES WITH HER FIANCE
"QUOTE I THOUGHT I WAS DOING SOMETHING WRONG OR THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE ME OR THAT HE WAS GAY "UNQUOTE
SHE SAYS IT WAS "QUOTE A WONDERFUL RELIEF "UNQUOTE WHEN DOCTORS TRACED HIS PROBLEM TO NERVE DAMAGE FROM BACK SURGERY AND TREATED IT WITH A MUSCLE RELAXING DRUG
A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE
THAT TEST WAS LESS THAN A COMPLETE SUCCESS
DIRT THAT ACCUMULATED IN THE KENAF DURING HARVESTING WASN'T ALL REMOVED AND ENDED UP IN THE PAPER
THE KENAF ALSO JAMMED IN SOME EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN CUT IN LENGTHS THAT WERE SEVERAL FEET LONG
BY SEPTEMBER THE WEAKNESS OF COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES FINALLY SURFACED
IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING INFLATION FEARS GERMANY AND JAPAN BEGAN TIGHTENING MONETARY POLICY AND RAISING INTEREST RATES
IN UNTIMELY FASHION SECRETARY BAKER REAFFIRMED THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES
IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SUBSTANTIAL FED TIGHTENING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PREVENT DOLLAR DECLINES U. S. INTEREST RATES SKYROCKETED
THE SEEDS OF MARKET DISCONTENT WERE SOWN
PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
THE COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF OR IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY

COMPUTERVISION THE PIONEER IN THE COMPUTERIZED DESIGN MARKET HAS HAD POOR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN RECENT YEARS AS IT REVAMPED ITS T- AGED PRODUCT LINE
HOWEVER RECENTLY IT HAS REPORTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED EARNINGS
ALTHOUGH IT HAS SLIPPED FROM FIRST TO THIRD IN SIZE IN THE INDUSTRY IT RETAINS A SUBSTANTIAL BASE OF CUSTOMERS
BUT WITH THE IMPORTED DOGS CAME PROBLEMS
ONE WAS COST
WHENEVER THEY STRAY FROM THE COUNTRY'S COOL CAPITAL THE NORTHERN BRED DOGS NEED AIR CONDITIONED ACCOMMODATION
SPECIAL VEHICLES HAVE BEEN BUILT TO SQUIRE THEM AROUND
EACH DOG NEEDS A TRAINER
A COOK PREPARES THE DOG CHOW
UPKEEP RUNS TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH PER CANINE TRIPLE THE SALARIES OF THE TRAINERS
ASKED ABOUT A NEW PRESIDENTIAL AID REQUEST JIM WRIGHT TALKED ABOUT MORALITY
IF I SCHEDULE IT THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE SOME MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PASS IT HE SAID
I DON'T WANT TO RUN IT OUT THERE AND BE DEFEATED AGAIN
MR. WRIGHT SHOULD BE LESS TIMID IN HIS CONVICTIONS
AFTER ALL HE ISN'T THE ONE WHO HAS TO RISK GETTING HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A METAL PIPE
A FALLING DOLLAR IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE U. S. IMPORTS MORE EXPENSIVE DECREASING DEMAND FOR THEM
BUT SOME FOREIGN PRODUCERS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO ADJUST PRICES TO REFLECT THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR CONTRIBUTING TO THE PERSISTENT GROWTH IN U. S. IMPORTS
IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS IMPORT PRICES HAVE CLIMBED SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT WHILE THE DOLLAR HAS FALLEN NINE POINT NINE PERCENT
GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
THE DEPUTY TREASURER DID IT SAYS FRANK KEEFE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MASTERMIND
HE OBVIOUSLY MUST BE DOING IT BECAUSE IT IS A PRUDENT AND PROFESSIONAL THING TO DO
AS FOR HIMSELF MR. KEEFE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE'S LEAVING HIS POST IN DECEMBER
BY THEN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH RECONVENES TODAY TO PICK UP THE BUDGET MESS WILL BE PLAYING WHAT DID THE GOVERNOR KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT
THE WORD IS TERROR
MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT SPENDING WOULD FALL SIX PERCENT OR ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO TWENTY FOUR POINT SIX THREE BILLION DOLLARS
AMTRAK SUBSIDIES WOULD BE ELIMINATED AND THE PASSENGER RAILROAD'S ASSETS SOLD BRINGING IN AN ESTIMATED ONE BILLION DOLLARS
BUT CONGRESS IS LIKELY TO BALK AND FINDING A BUYER FOR THE MONEY LOSING RAILROAD MAY BE TOUGH
THE BUDGET ALSO WOULD END DISCRETIONARY GRANTS FOR TRANSIT SYSTEMS AND CLOSE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION
CONGRESS HAS REJECTED SIMILAR CUTS BEFORE
MR. FUNARO DESCRIBED AS HOT AIR AND NONSENSE FOREIGN BANKERS' LANGUAGE IN THEIR CRITICISM OF BRAZIL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC POLICY
HE SAID NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT BRAZIL'S HIGH INFLATION WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING BIG SURPLUSES TO MEET DEBT PAYMENTS
INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR EXCUSES HE SAID THESE BANKS SHOULD REALIZE THERE'S A DEBT CRISIS AND IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY BOTH SIDES
BUT THE CORPSE WAS SOON WALKING
DURING THE PROGRESSIVE ERA PRESSURE FOR MORE FEDERAL SPENDING DEVELOPED
IN NINETEEN OH EIGHT THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM BACKED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW CONGRESS TO IMPOSE A NEW TAX DIRECTLY ON INCOME
IN JULY NINETEEN OH NINE CONGRESS SENT SUCH AN AMENDMENT TO THE STATES FOR RATIFICATION
BY EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX KIMBERLY CLARK'S RESILIENCE WAS BEING TESTED AGAIN
P. AND G. HAD BEATEN THE COMPANY TO THE MARKET WITH AN EXTRA THIN DIAPER CALLED ULTRA PAMPERS
KIMBERLY CLARK POSSESSED THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY SUPER ABSORBENT POLYMERS WHICH REPLACED SOME OF THE BULKY FLUFF AND WAS EVEN USING IT IN ITS ADULT INCONTINENCE PRODUCTS
BUT THE COMPANY DELAYED ITS PLANS FOR THIN BABY DIAPERS WHEN RESEARCH SHOWED THAT PARENTS DIDN'T THINK DIAPERS WERE ABSORBENT UNLESS THEY DOUBLED THE SIZE OF BABY'S BOTTOM
THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED
UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE
CURRENT HEMDALE HOLDERS THEN WOULD HAVE OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COMPUTER MEMORIES' SHARES
THE SURVIVING COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED HEMDALE FILM CORPORATION AND JOHN DALY HEMDALE'S CURRENT CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY
STANLEY NABI EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF BESSEMER SAID THEY'RE NOT REDUCING THEIR OFFER IF YOU CALCULATE THE OFFER'S VALUE AS OF THURSDAY'S CLOSE
I FIGURE IT WAS WORTH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON THURSDAY
WITH FRIDAY'S REVISION IT'S WORTH SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
THE REVISED TERMS ARE NO LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL TERMS IN THE POST CRASH MARKET
THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE ANALYSTS
IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE

THE FED'S POSTURE THROUGH ALL OF THIS IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE WILLIAM MCCHESNEY MARTIN FED OF THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES
THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION ABOUT MR. MARTIN'S PRIORITIES HE WAS FIRST OF ALL AN INFLATION FIGHTER AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY TO THE GOOD
BUT NO ONE WAS EVER SURE JUST HOW THE FED WOULD WAGE ITS INFLATION BATTLES
MR. MARTIN INDICATED HE WOULD LEAN AGAINST THE WIND WHEN HE SENSED INFLATION COMING AND HE DID
HE GOT RID OF THE INFLATION SURGE THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BUT IT TOOK THE DEEP NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT RECESSION TO DO SO

CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY

THE STOCK SPLIT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED ON OR ABOUT JULY SECOND TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON JUNE TWENTY SIXTH
AFTER THE DIVIDEND THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ABOUT SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
THE COMPANY SAID IT WILL DISCONTINUE PAYING THE PREVIOUS REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF FIFTEEN CENTS A SHARE AFTER THE STOCK DIVIDEND IS PAID TO CONSERVE CASH FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF CORPORATE PENSION PLANS HAVE MORE MONEY THAN THEY NEED THAT'S LARGELY DUE TO THE FIVE YEAR BULL MARKET IN STOCKS

DOZENS OF EMPLOYEES ARE NEEDED TO PROCESS THE PAPERWORK FOR THE THRIFT'S TINY MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO AND ITS RETAIL DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS
AIRLINES ALSO ROUTINELY HOLD THE LAST FLIGHT OF THE DAY TO A CERTAIN CITY FOR CONNECTING PASSENGERS

FOR A PREMIER CHEMICAL COMPANY TO CARRY SUCH A DISCOUNT NEAR THE END OF AN ECONOMIC CYCLE SEEMS SILLY TO ME
COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DENNIS PATRICK HOWEVER SAID HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO KEEP INDEPENDENT STATIONS ON CABLE SYSTEMS AS LONG AS THEY WERE POPULAR

CITICORP ATTRIBUTED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PROJECT WHICH FOCUSED ON OIL AND PETROCHEMICALS TO THE SHARP DECLINE IN OIL PRICES IN THE PAST YEAR

NO DOUBT MR. CHUN KNOWS HE HAS TO STEP DOWN
BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO ARRANGE IT SO THAT HE WILL STILL WIELD THE REAL POWER FROM BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN AFTER HIS RESIGNATION
HIS REPEATED EXPRESSIONS FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO STEP DOWN MUSTN'T BE SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO USHER IN SOME GENUINE DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN KOREA
WHAT KOREA IS NOW SUFFERING TO OVERCOME IS MAINLY A POLITICAL NOT ECONOMIC PROBLEM
REFORMS THAT DO NOT CHANGE THE PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM ARE NOT REFORMS
THE STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF OHIO HAS INVESTED IN REAL ESTATE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND RECENTLY EXPANDED INTO TIMBERLAND

ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER

ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS

THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAS SO HAPPY THAT IT IS USING A PHOTO FROM LIBERTY WEEKEND IN ADVERTISEMENTS TO ATTRACT BUSINESS TO THE STATE
THOSE WHO WATCHED THE EVENTS ON TELEVISION MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS LOVED THEM

AMERICAN EXPORTS HAVE DONE REAL WELL IN REAL TERMS HE EXPLAINED I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE
AT THE SAME TIME IMPORTS BY JAPAN AND EUROPE ESPECIALLY WEST GERMANY HAVE BEEN SPEEDING UP
THESE TRENDS HE SAID ARE REDRESSING THE TRADE IMBALANCES THAT HELPED PROVOKE THE DOLLAR'S FALL <NOISE>

IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WINOKUR DONATED HIS REMAINING EIGHTY PERCENT INTEREST IN FIVE WORKS THE MUSEUM THEN TOOK THOSE FIVE
WINOKUR VALUED THE ART HIMSELF AND TOOK PROPORTIONAL CHARITABLE DEDUCTIONS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS
THE DISPUTE IS A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MARKET PHILOSOPHIES
WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKETS
TOKYO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CLAIM TO FAVOR FREE MARKETS IN PRACTICE THEY OFTEN ARE LOATH TO RELINQUISH COMPLETE CONTROL ESPECIALLY IN PROMISING INDUSTRIES
INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
THE IMPROVEMENT IN SEPTEMBER'S TRADE DEFICIT MOSTLY CAME ON THE EXPORT SIDE
BUT BECAUSE OF THE POSTAL STRIKE THE DEADLINE FOR REPORTING EXPORTS WAS EXTENDED BY TWO DAYS
THAT DATA WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF PRECIOUS STONES AND AIRCRAFT RELATED ITEMS REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER
NOW QUICK RECOGNITION OF LOSSES IS NOT ONLY GOOD INVESTMENT STRATEGY BUT GOOD ECONOMIC STRATEGY
FULL DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD PROMOTE MOBILITY OF CAPITAL AND EFFICIENT PRICING OF ASSETS
IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PROMOTE MORE VENTURE CAPITAL WITH HIGH GAINS AND HIGH RISKS
MERE INDEXING BY CONTRAST WOULD HELP THE BIG AND DULL INVESTMENTS WITH LOW RISKS AND HUMDRUM REWARDS
BUT IF FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF LOSSES WOULD BE GOOD FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WOULD BE BAD IN TWO OTHER WAYS
THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
TEXAS STARTED EVALUATING POTENTIAL S. S. C. SITES ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW HAS SOLID DATA ON SIX LOCATIONS SAYS DILLARD HAMMETT STATE ENERGY ADVISER
FOUR MORE COMMUNITIES HAVE SINCE ASKED TO BE INCLUDED

THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO A PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE TO AUGUSTA NATIONAL'S ACCENT ON EXPERIENCE
THE COLOR THAT'S SECOND ONLY TO GREEN HEREABOUTS IS GRAY
IT CAN BE FOUND MOSTLY ON THE HEADS OF PARTICIPANTS AND SPECTATORS
GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS
MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO

SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW

A BANK SPOKESMAN SAID DETAILS OF THOSE LOANS WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL THE DELEGATION COMPLETES ITS WORK
ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
<NOISE> IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I. B. M. HAS BOUGHT PIECES OF NEARLY A DOZEN COMPANIES STEPPING UP THE PACE IN RECENT MONTHS
<NOISE> THE COMPUTER GIANT IS MAINLY TRYING TO BUY TECHNOLOGY OR EXPERTISE IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS SOFTWARE FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE CASE OF ITS POLICY MANAGEMENT STAKE
I. B. M. ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO BUY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS' LOYALTY IN THE INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY
<NOISE> INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
<NOISE> THEY'VE ADAPTED
TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
THE POINT VIRTUALLY EVERY ADVERTISER IN EVERY MEDIUM IS PAYING TO REACH VIEWERS OR READERS WHO NEVER BECOME CUSTOMERS
NO OTHER LIKELY BIDDERS STEPPED FORWARD YESTERDAY
HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE ALMOST UNHEARD OF IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY
BUT ANALYSTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT EITHER FORD MOTOR COMPANY OR GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT WITH BOEING IF THE COMPANIES WERE INTERESTED
FORD FOR INSTANCE HAS INDICATED IT IS LOOKING FOR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS ACCUMULATED ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IT COULD USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES
A FORD SPOKESMAN CITING COMPANY POLICY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY SPECULATION ABOUT ITS INTEREST
G. E. DECLINED COMMENT BUT A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANY SAID IT ISN'T INTERESTED IN BOEING
PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURER FIREMAN'S FUND HAS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE MADE THREE UNFORESEEN ADDITIONS TO RESERVES FOR CLAIMS TOTALING MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS
JOHN BYRNE FIREMAN'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE'S CONFIDENT FIREMAN'S IS USING EXCESS RESOURCES TO RETIRE STOCK
<NOISE> BUT HE CONCEDES BUY BACKS CAN BE RISKY FOR INSURERS
ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PER SHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
MR. SCHMIED IS BEING TESTED EARLY IN A POSITION HE DIDN'T SEEM EAGER TO OCCUPY
ANALYSTS SAY HE IS AN OPERATIONS MAN WHO NEVER EXHIBITED ANY AMBITION TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE
I NEVER GOT THE OVERWHELMING SENSE THAT HE WAS EAGER TO SUCCEED MR. FLAVIN SAYS CHRISTOPHER DEMISCH AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORP.
<NOISE> MOREOVER MR. SAWYER ISN'T THOUGHT TO POSSESS A LOT OF CLOUT
HE DOESN'T FIT THE BOSS IMAGE THAT THE LATE MAYOR DALEY MADE FAMOUS AND THAT MAYOR WASHINGTON WAS BEGINNING TO ACQUIRE
HE'S A WEAK GUY SAYS MR. ROSE THE POLITICAL CONSULTANT SUBJECT TO A LOT OF PRESSURE AND OBVIOUSLY NOT A CRUSADER
ASKED HOW HE VIEWED THE PRUDENTIAL BACHE UNIT MR. WINTERS SAID ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR RESULTS
<NOISE> OF COURSE NOT
ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR DIRECTION
YES
<NOISE> <NOISE> MR. WINTERS ADDED THAT PRUDENTIAL BACHE MAY BE MORE DELIBERATE THIS YEAR IN SOME OF ITS EXPANSION
HE ALSO VOICED CONFIDENCE IN CHAIRMAN GEORGE BALL DESPITE THE LOSSES CALLING HIM THE MOST QUALIFIED GUY IN THE U. S.
FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS A NEW COMPETITOR IN THE BOOK CLUB FIELD IS A GODSEND
BOOK CLUB RIGHTS ARE SECOND ONLY TO PAPERBACK RIGHTS IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR PUBLISHERS
FURTHERMORE A BOOK CLUB IMPRIMATUR ON A BOOK GIVES IT ENORMOUS CACHET WITH BOOKSTORE MANAGERS
<NOISE> NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
MANY BLAME THAT CHANGE ON SIMPLE GEOGRAPHY AND AN EFFORT TO MOVE AWAY FROM UNIONS
BUT SOME CRITICS ALSO ACCUSE THE JAPANESE COMPANIES OF DELIBERATELY AVOIDING BLACKS
<NOISE> HONDA AND THE U. S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION SETTLED A BIG RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CASE LAST MONTH
THE TWO LABORATORIES THAT NICHOLS PURCHASED ARE IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA AND SIOUX CITY IOWA
<NOISE> INITIAL PAYMENTS FOR THE LABS TOTALED ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND PREFERRED STOCK
ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO BE MADE OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD HAVE A CURRENT VALUE OF SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS NICHOLS SAID
THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE CONTINGENT UPON CERTAIN MATERIAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS OF THE TWO LABS REMAINING INTACT FOR THREE YEARS NICHOLS SAID
SINCE MONDAY'S OPENING BELL N. C. N. B. SHARES HAVE JUMPED FOUR AND THREE EIGHTHS POINTS CLOSING AT TWENTY SEVEN AND SEVEN EIGHTHS YESTERDAY
MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE STOCK COULD GO HIGHER SOON PERHAPS CROSSING THE THIRTY DOLLAR A SHARE BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR
LONG TERM BULLS PREDICT N. C. N. B.'S PRICE COULD EASILY DOUBLE AND SOME SAY TRIPLE
THE AGENCY HAS BEEN UNDER GROWING PRESSURE FROM REPRESENTATIVE JOHN DINGELL DEMOCRAT MICHIGAN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS TO TIGHTEN REGULATION OF THE GENERICS INDUSTRY
SENATOR ORRIN HATCH REPUBLICAN UTAH RANKING MINORITY MEMBER ON THE SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE WELCOMED THE PLAN
<NOISE> IT IS MY STRONG BELIEF THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN UNCOVERED TO WARRANT THESE CHANGES HE SAID IN A STATEMENT
IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORP. SPOKESMAN
STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
<NOISE> BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIKELY
SENATOR WILLIAM PROXMIRE DEMOCRAT WISCONSIN SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE FED FOR DROPPING THE M. ONE TARGET
HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT IT IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND UNWISE POLICY TO ALLOW M. ONE TO EXPAND AS RAPIDLY AS IT HAS
LAST YEAR M. ONE WHICH CONSISTS OF CHECKING DEPOSITS PLUS CASH HELD BY THE PUBLIC SOARED FIFTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
THAT WAS FAR ABOVE THE FED'S TARGET OF THREE PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT
WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
SOME HAVE CHARACTERIZED OUR COUNTERMEASURES AS PROTECTIONIST BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES
THAT IS DEAD WRONG
WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED TEN POINT SIX POINTS HIGHER AT TWENTY TWO SEVENTY ONE POINT EIGHT
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE ELEVEN POINT SIX TO SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE POINT FOUR
THE GOLD MINES INDEX FELL THREE POINT FIVE TO FOUR FORTY NINE POINT FIVE
VOLUME WAS LIGHT AT FOUR FIFTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH SEVEN FIFTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FRIDAY
THE CLEAREST INDICATION OF JAPAN'S BIOTECHNOLOGY AMBITIONS MAY BE THE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN THE FIELD BY THE MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY
WHEN M. I. T. I. GETS INVOLVED IT'S A SAFE BET THE NATION'S SENIOR STRATEGISTS HAVE TARGETED AN INDUSTRY FOR A BIG PUSH
THOUGH M. I. T. I. DOES SOME BIOTECH RESEARCH ITS MAIN ROLE IS TO SPUR AND GUIDE WORK BY OTHERS
LIKE A FISHING BOAT TOSSING CHUM IN THE WATER IT FIRST CHARTS A COURSE AND THEN PLANTS MONEY TO ATTRACT MORE
JAMES MAHONEY MR. CARSON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THE SPLIT WITH MR. BUSHKIN OCCURRED AFTER MR. CARSON DECIDED TO SELL HIS TELEVISION PRODUCTION BUSINESS
<NOISE> THERE AREN'T ANY FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES HE SAYS
THEY DIFFERED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS COMPANIES WERE BEING SOLD
MR. CARSON IS SAID TO HAVE DECIDED TO SELL CARSON PRODUCTIONS PIECEMEAL INSTEAD OF AS A GOING CONCERN
MR. BUSHKIN REPORTEDLY FAVORED KEEPING THE COMPANY WHOLE RATHER THAN AUCTIONING INDIVIDUAL ASSETS
FRESH FACES APPEAR AT THE RAINBOW KITCHEN ALMOST DAILY AMONG THEM A YOUNG COUPLE BACK FROM A DISILLUSIONING JOB HUNTING SOJOURN TO THE SUN BELT
THEY EXPECT TO BE ON THEIR FEET IN A MONTH
OTHERS SHOW UP BETWEEN ODD JOBS OR IN THE SUMMER WHEN THEIR CHILDREN CAN'T GET FREE LUNCH AT SCHOOL
HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE
HIS WEAPON THE PERSONAL BLESSING OF COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIYANG
AT THE APRIL OPENING OF A FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GUANGDONG POWER PLANT OFFICIALDOM HEAPED PRAISE ON MR. WU FOR BEATING A CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE
INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
TAEKWONDO LOOKS KIND OF LIKE KARATE SO I ASKED A KOREAN OFFICIAL FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SPORTS
TAEKWONDO IS KOREAN
KARATE IS JAPANESE HE SNAPPED AND TURNED AWAY
MR. PAPAGEORGE SAID THESE WERE CONCEPTUAL NEGOTIATIONS
IDEAS WERE FLOWING
WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE
BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
WARNER LAMBERT AND SCHERING PLOUGH ARE COVETED FOR THEIR OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR PRESCRIPTION SALES
OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
<NOISE> THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INCORPORATED SUBSIDIARY <NOISE> WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES <NOISE>
LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE <NOISE> SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
<NOISE> ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY <NOISE>
HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES <NOISE>
AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED
HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN
BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID <NOISE>
INSTEAD MR. REAGAN AGREED TO LOWER THE VOLUME OF HIS COMMENTS SUPPORTING THE CONTRAS AND CRITICIZING THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED <NOISE> CONGRESS
HE ALSO WOULD HOLD OFF ON ANY NEW PROPOSALS FOR CONTRA MILITARY AID UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
IF THE SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND A CEASEFIRE WAS IN PLACE MR. REAGAN WOULD END HIS CONTRA MILITARY AID PROGRAM
<NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
IN A NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING <NOISE> THE S. E. C.'S ENFORCEMENT DIVISION PRESSED FOR MR. KOBRIN'S PERMANENT EXPULSION FROM THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
THE DIVISION ARGUED THAT STOCK MANIPULATION OF THE KIND HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN WENT TO THE HEART OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
THE DIVISION ALSO SAID THE LAW DIRECTED THE S. E. C. TO ACT ON THE BELIEF THAT PAST MISCONDUCT RAISED A RISK OF FUTURE MISCONDUCT <NOISE> THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY EXPULSION
CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS <NOISE>
<NOISE> THEY SAY THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO BOOST MEMBERSHIP IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH AIRLINES CONSIDER CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING BRAND LOYALTY
THESE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS SAYS A UNITED SPOKESMAN
<NOISE> MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE
WE THOUGHT THERE WAS VERY BROAD JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOND AUCTION SAID MR. LAKEFIELD OF SHEARSON LEHMAN <NOISE>
BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE BOUGHT FOR SHORT TERM TRADING ACCOUNTS OR FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT <NOISE>
THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT <NOISE>
IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
<NOISE> THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON <NOISE> ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
<NOISE> AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
<NOISE> BUT SERVICE MERCHANDISE JUMPED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND A AND A QUARTER ON ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND A QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER
SINCE THEN THE STOCK HAS BEEN RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMORS
<NOISE> WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL <NOISE> MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT <NOISE>
<NOISE> IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP <NOISE>
PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS
THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE PERCENT
BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES
PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS
<NOISE> AND WITH THE GUILD CHOOSING SUCH A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STRIKE T. V. PRODUCTION OFFICIALS ARE ESPECIALLY IRATE <NOISE>
WHEN MY FAMILY FLED WE LEFT MY NANNY IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE
<NOISE> BUT SOON A LIEUTENANT IN THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY EVICTED HER AND INSTALLED HIS MISTRESS
LATER THE HOUSE WENT TO THE NORTH KOREANS <NOISE>
F. D. A. RESEARCHERS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH YET ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF FAT SUBSTITUTES MIXING WITH MEDICATION AND OTHER SUBSTANCES
TYPICALLY LAB TESTS ON FOOD PRODUCTS ARE FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF RATS OR MICE ABOUT FOUR YEARS
RESEARCHERS SAY THEY AREN'T SURE SUCH TESTS PARALLEL HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF FAT OVER LONGER PERIODS
WE JUST DON'T KNOW SAYS THE F. D. A.'S MR. MERTZ
WITH EVERY NEW DEVELOPMENT THERE ARE RISKS
<NOISE> <NOISE> ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TALKS SURPRISED ANALYSTS AND FAILED TO IMPRESS INVESTORS
BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES FELL TWENTY FIVE PENCE OR FORTY FOUR CENTS TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE PENCE IN LATE TRADING YESTERDAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
THE HANDFUL OF ROVER SHARES TRADING JUMPED NINETEEN PENCE TO EIGHTY SIX PENCE AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT BUT FELL BACK TO EIGHTY TWO PENCE
<NOISE> MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL <NOISE> BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT <NOISE> <NOISE>
MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX DOLLARS
AS A RECENT VISIT REVEALED THE SOUP KITCHEN HAS BECOME A POWERFUL MAGNET DRAWING HUNDREDS WHO COME FOR MORE THAN JUST DAILY NOURISHMENT
MR. KOVACS AN OCTOGENARIAN WHO CROONS LOVE BALLADS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN COMES FOR CAMARADERIE
FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE
HE ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO PICKED UP A BROOM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD STARTED CLEANING UP HE NOW GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE
THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
THE SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
<NOISE> GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
<NOISE> WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
AND REVENUES SLUMP
THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
<NOISE> INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS
TAKEOVER TALK AROUSED INTEREST IN TWO FINANCIAL CONCERNS
MERCANTILE BANCORP SOARED FIVE AND A HALF TO THIRTY AND THREE QUARTERS ON RENEWED BUY OUT SPECULATION <NOISE>
SUN STATE SAVINGS AND LOAN ENDED AT EIGHT AND A QUARTER UP TWO AFTER CONFIRMING THAT IT RECEIVED AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION PROPOSAL FROM AN INVESTMENT GROUP
IN HOUSTON A COASTAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER
WE ANTICIPATE ASKING FOR A REHEARING OR APPEALING TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SPOKESMAN SAID
HE ADDED WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THE REVERSAL
WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID CASE
<NOISE> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE BY AN IDEA SHE SAYS POINTING TO A VIDEO GAME
SEE THAT MACHINE <NOISE>
THAT'S AN IDEA
ROCK AND ROLL
THAT'S AN IDEA
IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT ONE EIGHT TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE
<NOISE> THE DECLINE SNAPPED A STRING OF FIVE RECORD CLOSINGS <NOISE>
THE STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX FELL TWELVE POINT NINE TWO POINTS TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN POINT SIX NINE <NOISE>
VOLUME TOTALED ABOUT ONE BILLION SHARES
MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAME HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW <NOISE>
<NOISE> PEOPLE THINK THE A IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE <NOISE>
IN AMSTERDAM STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN VOLATILE TRADING
<NOISE> SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID <NOISE>
VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION PRODUCED WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT <NOISE>
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
<NOISE> <NOISE> CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
THE SHORTAGE OF WESTERN CAPACITY MAKES SOVIET LAUNCHERS ATTRACTIVE
A SERIES OF LAUNCH DISASTERS INCLUDING THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION SEVERELY CURTAILED WESTERN ACCESS TO SPACE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN
THE EUROPEAN ARIANE LAUNCHER JUST RETURNED TO COMMERCIAL SERVICE
THE U. S. SPACE PROGRAM WILL NOT ELIMINATE ITS BACKLOG OF PAYLOADS UNTIL THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES
YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD
<NOISE> <NOISE> THINK AGAIN
HE'S NOT ALONE <NOISE>
CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR <NOISE> EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
THE ONE ELEMENT OF SUSPENSE REMAINS THE SELECTION OF A RUNNING MATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
BUSH MANAGERS INSIST THEY WON'T DISCLOSE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE'S IDENTITY UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING
REAGAN ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION SITE LAST NIGHT AND PREPARED FOR HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE PARTY TONIGHT
THE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR CALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND BUSH WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CONVENTION
IT IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN WHICH BUSH MUST ATTEMPT TO MOVE OUT FROM UNDER REAGAN'S SHADOW AND ESTABLISH HIS OWN IDENTITY
PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS
FRANCE FUND INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF FOURTEEN POINT FOUR SIX DOLLARS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TEN AND ONE EIGHTH AS OF THURSDAY
GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF NINE DOLLARS AND THIRTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AS OF FRIDAY
IN THE LISTING OF PUBLICLY TRADED FUNDS IN AN EARLIER EDITION THE LINES WERE REVERSED
BANCROFT CONVERTIBLE FUND INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TWENTY SEVEN AND ONE QUARTER AS OF FRIDAY
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOME GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES C. I. A. HAD TO GIVE UP FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
NOW IT IS SUGGESTED THAT OFFICIALS GAVE UP FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS
IN NINETEEN NINETY SOMEONE IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GIVE UP THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTING THEM FROM UNLAWFUL SEARCHES
WHY NOT
THEY MAY BE HIDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THEIR HOMES
CABLE OPERATORS ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRICE CUTTING PROGRAMS
FOR ONE THING BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION WHICH I- TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST THE OPERATORS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RAISE RATES FOR BASIC CABLE SERVICE
IN ADDITION THE PAY NETWORKS ARE CUTTING THE PRICES THEY CHARGE OPERATORS
CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
REPRESENTATIVE BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN
COMPETITION FUELS EXCELLENCE HE SAID AND THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD A SOLID ROCKET MOTOR WITH BETTER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCTION
ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS
THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM
U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND A TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO
MAKING MATTERS WORSE THE HARVEST RIPENING IN THE FIELDS PROMISES TO BE A MONSTER PORTENDING RECORD POST HARVEST SUPPLIES OF CORN AND A GLUT OF OTHER COMMODITIES
TO HELP CUT PRODUCTION THE U. S. IS PAYING FARMERS AN ANNUAL RENT FOR TEN YEARS TO IDLE EROSION PRONE CROP LAND UNDER A CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL *INCORPORATED* AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES *INCORPORATED*
THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER *PATIENTS* TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
BUT HE WARNS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD ASK HOW MUCH STOCK IS TOO MUCH
A DIRECTOR HOLDING A LARGE BLOCK MAY BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN SHORT TERM RESULTS THAN LONG TERM CORPORATE HEALTH
THAT DIRECTOR MAY ALSO BE MORE TEMPTED TO VOTE HIS POCKETBOOK IN A TAKEOVER *FIGHT* SAYS MR. WOLF
AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK
BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS LUCRATIVE FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA
BRITISH AIRWAYS GAVE UP ONLY A FEW ROUTES FROM GATWICK TO EUROPEAN CITIES WHICH IN MOST CASES IT ALREADY SERVED FROM HEATHROW
MR. BAKER IS ALSO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH RUDOLPH *GIULIANI* THE U. S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN WHO IS OVERSEEING THAT OFFICE'S INVESTIGATION OF DREXEL

ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION
THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO ZERO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO ZERO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
HE ALSO WAS EMPHATIC ABOUT KEEPING BURGER KING
I WANT TO SAY WITHOUT QUALIFICATION THAT BURGER KING IS CENTRAL TO PILLSBURY
IT WAS TRUE YESTERDAY IT IS TRUE TODAY AND IT REMAINS TRUE FOR THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC FUTURE HE SAID
SOME ISSUERS ALSO ARE WARY OF DOING AWAY WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL
IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR
ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER
MR. MORELAND COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT BUT ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING HIM HAVE PREVIOUSLY DENIED HE COMMITTED ANY ACTS OF FRAUD
AN ATTORNEY FOR MR. REYNOLDS IN SAN DIEGO SAID WE FEEL OUR CLIENT DID NOTHING IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES LAWS

THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
FURTHER SIGNS OF STRONG U. S. ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FROM A LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORT NEXT FRIDAY ON THE NATION'S EMPLOYMENT PICTURE FOR AUGUST

WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS

AS A RESULT IT CAN MAKE SALES IN KEEPING WITH MARKET CONDITIONS WITHOUT HAVING A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ITS ECONOMY MR. NICHOLS SAID
LAST YEAR IT ESTIMATED THE SOVIET UNION MADE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM SALES OF PALLADIUM
IT MADE BILLIONS ON GOLD
THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE OF OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUGGESTED WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC THAT SUCH CASES MIGHT INVOLVE MISAPPROPRIATION OR ILLEGAL USE OF INFORMATION
A DECISION IN THE WINANS CASE MAY HELP DEFINE SECURITIES FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION
THESE TEENS CRAVE EXCITEMENT
THEY SPURN REST AND RECREATION
THEY DREAM ABOUT POWER AND POTS OF MONEY
ESPECIALLY MONEY
LAST MONTH PIEDMONT'S BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY ACCEPT NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY FOR SIXTY FIVE *DOLLARS* A SHARE
NORFOLK SOUTHERN HAS HAD A STAKE IN PIEDMONT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
BUT ONE DAY AFTER THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION U. S. AIR SWEETENED ITS INITIAL BID FOR PIEDMONT FORCING THE BOARD TO DROP ITS RECOMMENDATION
INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
WAS THAT THE EARTH SHIFTING IN MIKE KINSLEY'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN YESTERDAY ON THE PAGE OPPOSITE A *DEMOCRATS'* GUIDE TO ROBERT BORK
MR. KINSLEY CALLED THE ROE V.
WADE ABORTION DECISION ONE OF THE JUDICIAL EXCESSES OF ACTIVIST JUDGES
THEN WE FOUND OURSELVES DESCRIBED AS THE CENTER OF CONSERVATIVE INTELLECTUAL HYPOCRISY ON JUDICIAL RESTRAINT
WE BELIEVE WE'RE COMING TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF NEOLIBERAL AN EX LIBERAL WHO ATTACKS CONSERVATIVES IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING THEIR POSITIONS
THE FINDING UNIFORMLY SURPRISED LONGTIME RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD
THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE BEHIND T. H. A. SAYS DOCTOR LEON THAL A RESEARCHER AT SAN DIEGO VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL
BUT THE RESULTS WERE OVERWHELMING AND WHEN YOU GET RESULTS LIKE THAT OUT OF THE BLUE THE FIRST REACTION IS TO BE SKEPTICAL
THAT TEST WAS LESS THAN A COMPLETE SUCCESS
DIRT THAT ACCUMULATED IN THE KENAF DURING HARVESTING WASN'T ALL REMOVED AND ENDED UP IN THE PAPER
THE KENAF ALSO JAMMED IN SOME EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN CUT IN LENGTHS THAT WERE SEVERAL FEET LONG
REPRESENTATIVE FOLEY SAID THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT A DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE SHOULD CONSIST HALF OF SPENDING CUTS AND HALF REVENUE RAISING MEASURES
BUT NEGOTIATORS STILL COULDN'T AGREE ON WHAT CONSTITUTES REVENUE RAISERS OR SPENDING CUTS
HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER ROBERT MICHEL OF ILLINOIS COMPLAINED I'M JUST ASKING THE DEMOCRATS TO GIVE US REAL SAVINGS

EVEN AFTER FINDING A BUYER COMPLETING A FORECLOSURE SALE IS HARDLY ROUTINE
BROKERS AT MERRILL LYNCH REALTY RECALL A SALE THAT WAS DELAYED FOR A MONTH BY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIEN ON THE PROPERTY
ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED
WE WERE AT THE CLOSING TABLE WHEN THIS ALL CAME OUT SAYS WANDA HUTCHINS THE MERRILL LYNCH AGENT
INVALID FORECLOSURES ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE
THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PREMARIN BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORPORATION'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF PREMARIN LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID PREMARIN ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
<NOISE> AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM
IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
DESPITE WORRIES ABOUT INVESTMENT BANKERS LENDING MONEY FOR BUYOUTS MORGAN STANLEY DID BETTER THAN OWENS ILLINOIS' PUBLIC BONDHOLDERS WILL DO
ANNUALIZED IT EARNS EIGHTY PERCENT PRE TAX ON ITS THREE MONTH THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LOAN TO OWENS ILLINOIS MR. NIEHAUS SAYS
THAT INCLUDES INTEREST OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND INVESTMENT BANKING FEES OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
THIRTEEN YEARS AGO MR. SMITH WAS MIRED IN PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS
NOW HE LIVES LIKE A SUCCESSFUL CORPORATE EXECUTIVE
BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
HIS IS A TAX EXEMPT NOT FOR PROFIT CORPORATION DEDICATED TO HELPING MINORS THE SICK AND THE NEEDY
IT ALSO HAS GREATLY HELPED THE SMITH FAMILY
LAST YEAR THE CORPORATION PAID THE SMITHS AND A SON IN LAW MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SALARIES AND BONUSES
MR. SMITH ALSO HAD AN OUTSTANDING UNSECURED PERSONAL LOAN OF A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ENJOYED OTHER PERQUISITES
AS FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT AUTHORIZES ALL THIS WELL FOUR SMITHS HUSBAND WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN CURRENTLY ARE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY
URANIUM FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY FALLEN UNDER ANTI APARTHEID SANCTIONS
BUT LAST YEAR SAID THE URANIUM INSTITUTE U. S. IMPORTS OF SOUTH AFRICAN URANIUM SURGED THREE HUNDRED PERCENT TO MORE THAN THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION POUNDS
ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE DELIVERIES TOOK PLACE IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE LAST MONTH BEFORE THE EMBARGO TOOK EFFECT
RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
<NOISE> ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND A HALF TO TWENTY ONE
SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS
AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
THE DIRT ROAD COMES TO A PAVED INTERSECTION AND MR. KGORI BEGINS A RIGHT TURN
UP AHEAD HE SPOTS A ROADBLOCK WHERE A WHITE POLICEMAN WITH A DOG IS HOLDING UP THREE BLACKS TRAVELING ON A DONKEY PULLED WAGON
MR. KGORI DECIDES TO GO STRAIGHT ON THE DIRT ROAD EVEN THOUGH IT WILL TAKE HIM AN HOUR OUT OF HIS WAY
THAT WAS ILLUSTRATED BY A TEMPORARY SURGE IN SECURITIES LENDING DURING LAST OCTOBER'S CRASH AND A PREVIOUS SECURITIES SETTLEMENT BACKLOG IN BRITAIN
SAID ONE U. K. MONETARY OFFICIAL CLEARLY THERE WAS DEMAND IN THE MARKET FOR MORE EQUITIES MONEY BROKING
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING WITH SHEARSON'S MOVE IS A REFLECTION OF THAT DEMAND
SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS
HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK

THE INVESTORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD SAID PAUL BERNSTEIN AN ATTORNEY FOR ONE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS
HE SAID THE ALLEGED OMISSIONS MAKE THE PROSPECTUS MISLEADING
<NOISE> THE SUITS SEEK DAMAGES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OFFERING PRICE AND THE MARKET PRICE WHEN THE SUITS WERE FILED
TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN

A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION
PRICES MOVED UP IN RESPONSE TO NEWS THAT U. S. DURABLE GOODS ORDERS DECLINED SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT IN JANUARY
PRICES ALSO SLID AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE TOWER COMMISSION REPORT ON THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR
BUT BY LATE IN THE SESSION ISSUES HAD FIRMED AGAIN
MR. EPSTEIN SAID HE SET SOME VERY SHORT RANGE GOALS TO HELP PENRIL GET BACK INTO THE BLACK
HIS PLANS INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING SOME DEBT AND SELLING ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FIVE DIVISIONS TO HELP GENERATE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO FINANCE THE GROWTH OF THE OTHER FOUR
HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE DIVISION THAT WILL BE SOLD
THE LOOK AND FEEL CASES ARE GENERATING CONTROVERSY IN THE INDUSTRY
COMPANIES BRINGING THE SUITS SAY THEY ARE DEFENDING THE REWARDS DUE THOSE WHO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING CUT RATE COPIES
BUT OTHERS ARGUE THAT NEW SOFTWARE ALWAYS BORROWS FROM THE OLD <NOISE>
THEY SAY LOTUS IF ITS SUIT SUCCEEDS WILL STIFLE INNOVATION AND DISCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF STANDARDS THAT HELP COMPUTER USERS MASTER SOFTWARE MADE BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES
CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
REPRESENTATIVE BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN

MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
POLITICAL OBSERVERS THEORIZE THAT THE POLITICAL REHABILITATION IS LINKED TO THIS INVISIBLE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
SOME SAY FOR INSTANCE THAT MR. DE LA MADRID PUT THE FORMER MINISTER ON DISPLAY TO GOAD OTHER CANDIDATES INTO WORKING HARDER
OTHERS SUGGEST THAT ONE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL IS USING THE POPULAR MR. SILVA HERZOG TO UNDERMINE HIS RIVALS
THE MOST PROVOCATIVE HYPOTHESIS HAS IT THAT MR. SILVA HERZOG HAS HIMSELF BECOME A CANDIDATE AGAIN
WE ARE AWARE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILLINGLY ACCEPT THEM THE BANKER OBSERVES
BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WE ALREADY HAVE A PERMISSIVE POLICY HE SAYS
MR. WRIGHT DIDN'T LIST THOSE EARNINGS ON NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PERSONAL FINANCE DISCLOSURE FORMS
ATTORNEY DANIEL SWILLINGER SAID AT A MINIMUM HE SHOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THIS THE SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR ESCROW AS AN ASSET

WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
LAFARGE ALSO NAMED ROBERT W. MURDOCH FORTY FOUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

U. S. BANK REGULATIONS ARE ANOTHER STUMBLING BLOCK
CURRENTLY BANKS CAN'T OWN MORE THAN NINETEEN POINT NINE PERCENT OF A NON FINANCIAL COMPANY AND CAN ONLY BE PASSIVE INVESTORS

IVAN TOMS ISN'T IN A FESTIVE MOOD AS HE CONTEMPLATES HIS IMPENDING CONFRONTATION WITH THE MILITARY
I KNOW IT WILL BE HORRIFIC HE SAYS STARING DOWN AT HIS LUNCH BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS STAND
I THINK INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
THE BUDGET HOWEVER WILL NOT MANAGE ITSELF
SOME WAY MUST BE FOUND TO PUT IT ON COURSE
IN OUR HISTORY AN IMPASSE OVER POLICY HAS BEEN BROKEN OCCASIONALLY BY SOME SORT OF NATIONAL COMMISSION AND IT IS TIME FOR ONE AGAIN
SUCH A COMMISSION RESOLVED THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROBLEM EARLIER IN THIS DECADE
IN THE JOHNSON YEARS A COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS WERE THE MEANS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE BUDGET
STILL EARLIER IT WAS A COMMISSION THAT RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
THIS APPROACH ENABLES THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO AVOID SOME FLAK BY MERELY IMPLEMENTING WHAT THE COMMISSION TOLD US TO DO
THUS THE BOARD SAID IT WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO GIVE BANK OF NEW YORK MORE THAN ONE EXTENSION OF THE INITIAL NINETY DAYS TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER
NORMALLY EXTENSIONS OF THE NINETY DAY RULE ARE GRANTED FREELY
BUT IN THE PENDING MERGER THE BOARD WANTS TO AVOID A LONG AND FRUITLESS STRUGGLE SAID MICHAEL BRADFIELD THE FED'S GENERAL COUNSEL
ONE OF THE MORE DIRECT READINGS ON INFLATION WILL COME IN FRIDAY'S REPORT ON CONSUMER PRICES WHICH ARE EXPECTED NOT SURPRISINGLY TO BE HIGHER
ANALYSTS EXPECT AN INCREASE OF ABOUT POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE APRIL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ON THE HEELS OF A POINT FIVE PERCENT JUMP THE PREVIOUS MONTH
THE PRICE INCREASES ARE EXPECTED PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AS COMMODITIES AND SERVICES ARE RISING AT ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL RATE
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND
TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST

UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
IN JANUARY SIGNS OF A WEAKENING ECONOMY PROMPTED CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN JOHNSON TO PUSH THROUGH A SLIGHT EASING OF POLICY ALLOWING INTEREST RATES TO FALL
GOVERNOR ANGELL WORRIED BY THE STRONG COMMODITY PRICES WAS RELUCTANT TO GO ALONG

IN SUCH AGREEMENTS CALLED REPOS ONE PARTY SELLS GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TO ANOTHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SELLER WILL REPURCHASE THEM LATER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE
THE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS WOULD APPLY TO GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKERS OR DEALERS THAT ARE ALREADY REGISTERED AS WELL AS TO NEWLY REGISTERED ENTITIES
NEVERTHELESS INTEREST RATES FELL ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS SOLD YESTERDAY AT THE GOVERNMENT'S WEEKLY AUCTION

KUKJE CORPORATION SHIFTED F- FROM PRODUCING NIKE SHOES TO DEVELOPING ITS OWN PRO SPECS LINE OF ATHLETIC SHOES FIVE YEARS AGO
IT PAID FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND GOODS TO BE AN OFFICIAL SPONSOR OF THE GAMES AND HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE LOGO IN ITS ADVERTISING
KUKJE HOPES THE OLYMPICS WILL GIVE PRO SPECS A FOOTHOLD IN EUROPE
VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY

THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES <NOISE> SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY

THE PLEA AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BROAD SETTLEMENT OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
BECAUSE THE FIRM AGREED THAT IT COMMITTED FELONIES SECURITIES COMMISSIONERS IN MOST STATES CAN AUTOMATICALLY REVOKE DREXEL'S LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS
WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT ARE OFTEN NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF R. I. C. O. THAN FROM REAL FELONS

IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
MOST ANALYSTS SAID THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OF THE TWO BANKS MAKE A GOOD FIT
GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS A STRONG NETWORK IN AFRICA WHILE AMRO HAS MORE OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND FAR EAST

THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR

IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE LEARNING OUR WAY WITH THE ALLANTE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
THE CAR IS DOING THE THINGS THAT WE WANT IT TO DO FOR US AS FAR AS GETTING VISIBILITY FOR THE DIVISION AND BEING AN IMAGE CAR
SINCE IT'S BEEN A NEW ENTITY FOR CADILLAC AND OUR DEALERS WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL SALES VOLUME WOULD BE

BENETTON DENIES ALL CHARGES ON THE SPECIFIC ACCUSATIONS BY UNHAPPY STORE OWNERS AND STEADFASTLY MAINTAINS THAT IT ISN'T A FRANCHISE OPERATION AND THUS ISN'T SUBJECT TO FRANCHISE REQUIREMENTS
STORE OWNERS IT SAYS ARE LICENSEES BECAUSE THEY OWN THEIR STORES AND DON'T PAY ROYALTIES TO BENETTON AS FRANCHISEES TYPICALLY DO
ALTHOUGH IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT A FEW STORE OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED IT BLAMES ANY PROBLEMS ON THE OWNERS THEMSELVES OR ON ITS FIELD REPRESENTATIVES WHO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THEM

OR WHAT IF THE WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED AND SLAVERY JUST DRIFTED ON AND ON
WOULD THE SOUTH HAVE BECOME ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICA
I WOULDN'T BET AGAINST IT <NOISE>
IT STILL ISN'T CLEAR WHAT FORM THE INCREASES WILL TAKE OR WHEN THEY WILL GO INTO EFFECT
SOME CARRIERS SAID THEY PLAN TO RAISE FARES SUNDAY AND OTHERS SAID THEY WILL ACT A WEEK LATER

THEY NEED ONLY LISTEN TO THE GROUP OF EIGHT WOMEN GATHERED HERE FOR A DISCUSSION OF WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS IN FASHION RETAILING

<NOISE> <NOISE> DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER THE FED NUDGED UP SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES TO RESTRAIN THE ECONOMY
BUT WORRIED AS ALWAYS ABOUT BECOMING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL THE FED TRIED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION
THAT STRATEGY WAS HELPED BY AN APPARENT SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHICH EASED INFLATION WORRIES AND ALLOWED THE FED TO STOP PUSHING UP RATES

THAT IS DEAD WRONG
WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
SUCH COST CUTTING EFFORTS HAVE WORSENED LABOR DISPUTES WHICH HAVE IN TURN PITTED NON UNION PILOTS AGAINST PRO UNION PILOTS
FIRST OFFICER GUY CASEY WAS ONCE A CAPTAIN AT CONTINENTAL BUT LOST HIS SENIORITY DURING THE BITTER STRIKE THERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO ORGANIZE
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT THE EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY

IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
<NOISE> IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A !WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FOREIGN PURCHASES BEGIN THEY OFTEN INVOLVE THE VERY PARTS THAT MAKE WEAPONS PERFORM
FOR EXAMPLE F. M. C. CORP.'S BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE DEPENDS ON A SOPHISTICATED SENSOR SYSTEM FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO INFORM SOLDIERS OF POTENTIAL THREATS AND TARGETS
WITHOUT THIS PART TUCKED INTO THE TURRET OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE THE BRADLEY WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY HELPLESS ON THE BATTLEFIELD
MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
FEDERAL TAXPAYERS WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE
THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
BUT NETWORK OFFICIALS WILL SPEND MONTHS DEBATING C. B. S.'S WISDOM
IT'S TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE SAID MR. PILSON TESTILY TAKING ON REPORTERS AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE
I'M UP HERE STATING THAT C. B. S. HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS AND N. B. C. HASN'T
AT N. B. C. MR. WATSON WAS PHILOSOPHIC IF PRAGMATIC YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A WINNER HE SAID
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AT THE SAME TIME
THE TOTAL CUT WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT OF COFFEE SOLD AND NOT EXCEED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BAGS
ONE BAG EQUALS SIXTY KILOS
THE ANNUAL GLOBAL EXPORT QUOTA IS FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION BAGS
IN ANOTHER TRADE DISPUTE KANSAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CORP. HAS COME UNDER ATTACK
JAPAN INSISTS THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF A NEW AIRPORT AT OSAKA IS PRIVATE AND NOT SUBJECT TO MINISTRY ORDERS
FOREIGNERS SAY THAT IT IS A SEMANTIC ARGUMENT BECAUSE NEARLY FOUR FIFTHS OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVES HAIL FROM GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES
THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE MOSLEM LEAGUE CAME INTO THE SHARED POWER ARRANGEMENT MR. IJAZ ALI GOT INTO THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
THERE HE WRUNG THOUSANDS OF RUPEES FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD ROADS SCHOOLS AND ELECTRIFICATION SYSTEMS IN HIS DISTRICT
THE GOVERNMENT'S IDEA WAS TO OUTFLANK THE P. P. P. OPPOSITION THROUGH PUBLIC WORKS
DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THE ARMY PLAYS AN INCALCULABLE ROLE IN KEEPING PAKISTAN'S DISTORTED ECONOMY PERKING
MR. JONES THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PAKISTANI HOUSEHOLDS FOUR PERCENT OF THE ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE ONES HAVE SENT YOUNG MEN INTO THE ARMY
ADD IN THE HOUSEHOLDS INVOLVED IN SERVICES FOR THE MILITARY AND NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF THE NATION'S HOUSEHOLDS ARE INVOLVED
U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR
IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
AND DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES LEBANESE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY'S TOP MIDDLE EAST OPERATIVES ROBERT AMES AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY
AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM
MOREOVER ANY TAX REFORM MUST CLEAR PARLIAMENT'S UPPER HOUSE THE BUNDESRAT WHERE THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION CLINGS TO A MAJORITY
<NOISE> SOME BANKS HAVE ALREADY TURNED CERTAIN DEBTS INTO SECURITIES WHICH SO FAR THEY HAVE HELD RATHER THAN SELLING
TO GET AROUND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT LIMITS ON DEBT RESERVES A GROUP OF JAPANESE BANKS TURNED SOME THIRD WORLD DEBT INTO PREFERRED STOCK EARLIER THIS YEAR
AND SHEARSON IS ABOUT TO START MARKETING A MUTUAL FUND TO BANKS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BANKS TO SWAP PHILIPPINE DEBT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THAT COUNTRY
THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET IS AWASH WITH LIQUIDITY MR. GRANT SAYS
BUT IN JUNE SUDDENLY WITH NO APPARENT DRAINAGE IT WENT DOWN AND KEPT GOING DOWN HE SAYS
WHAT IS A MYSTERY TO MR. GRANT AND MANY OTHERS IS THAT THE TOKYO MARKET HAS SINCE STAGED A VIGOROUS REBOUND
THE PHILIP MORRIS MAGAZINE ENJOYS BY FAR THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION OF ANY COMPANY MAGAZINE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION COPIES
THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE
NON U. S. BORROWERS ALSO REPORTEDLY MAY COME TO MARKET
THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA MAY LAUNCH A LONG DATED EUROYEN ISSUE PERHAPS TOTALING EIGHTY BILLION YEN SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS
JAPAN FINANCE CORP. FOR A MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISES IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE A SEVEN YEAR ISSUE THAT MAY TOTAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EARLY TODAY
MITSUI AND COMPANY HAS A MINORITY STAKE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT FUND THAT ACQUIRED CONTROL OF JOSEPH HORNE COMPANY IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
A CHART IN AN EARLIER EDITION INCORRECTLY LISTED MITSUI ITS ROLE AND THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION
IN ADDITION THE CHART OMITTED SEVERAL LARGE RECENT JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS BECAUSE OF A PRODUCTION ERROR
THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE
BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER
ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS
STILL THERE ARE WAYS AROUND THE NO DOCUMENTS DILEMMA
SAYS DAVIS DWYER <NOISE> A WINTHROP GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR MY FIRST STOP IS TO GO TO THE FACTORY AND SAY WHO IS THE BUFF
THERE'S ALWAYS A BUFF
IN ONE CASE HE FOUND AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD SAVED EVERY COPY OF THE COMPANY'S IN HOUSE MAGAZINE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS
THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED HE SAYS
WE HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS THAN WE DID BEFORE
HE'S PLANNING ON SPENDING SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION THIS YEAR COMPARED WITH A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST
CONDOM SALES FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED IN APRIL
CARTER WALLACE'S SHARE AMOUNTS TO OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET
ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
LAST YEAR AFTER WORLD STOCK PRICES CRASHED THE MARKET FOR DOMESTIC JAPANESE CONVERTIBLE BONDS FELL BRIEFLY
BY THE START OF THIS YEAR CONVERTIBLE ISSUES WITH A PAR VALUE OF MORE THAN FOUR TRILLION YEN WERE TRADING AT BELOW THEIR ISSUE PRICE
THEY QUICKLY RECOVERED THOUGH THANKS TO A BOOM IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THE RELATIVELY RELAXED RATE OF NEW CONVERTIBLE BOND ISSUES
THE U. S. HAS BEEN ASKING DAMASCUS FOR HELP BUT THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTING
WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT EXASPERATED SAYS A SENIOR U. S. OFFICIAL
THEY AREN'T DOING ALL THEY COULD DO
AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
AT THIS POINT COMPETING DEVELOPERS WERE EYEING THE PROJECT
UNDER ITS GROUND LEASE WITH THE CITY AND STATE THE PARTNERSHIP MIGHT BE FOUND IN DEFAULT ON ITS CONTRACT ENABLING A COMPETING DEVELOPER TO TAKE OVER
TO STAVE OFF AN ATTACK MR. HARRISON SAYS OUR POSITION WAS THAT WE WERE NEVER IN DEFAULT ON OUR LEASE
WE MAINTAIN THAT THE BANK STOPPED FUNDING
I'M POSITIVE ON THE MOVE TO HIS NEW POST MR. RHINES SAID
I GREW UP IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR GROUP
MR. RHINES HELD A NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN THE COMPANY'S SEMICONDUCTOR OPERATIONS BEFORE TAKING THE DATA SYSTEMS JOB IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
HALLMARK HOWEVER HAS SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE THESE STATIONS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE FORMAT
THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
THESE ARE THE REALITIES OF SOUTH AFRICA SAYS MR. DE BEER
HIS EYEBROWS ARCH ONCE AGAIN
WHAT DO WE DO
ROBERT MCCLEMENTS JUNIOR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID SUN CONTINUES TO SEEK AN ACQUISITION THAT WILL PROVIDE THE RIGHT MIX OF ASSETS
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID SUN IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LARGE IN THE AREA OF ENERGY RESERVES
THE SPOKESMAN SAID SUN HAS MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL THAT IT HAS GAINED FROM SPINOFFS AND DIVESTITURES OF COMPANIES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
DOLE STRATEGISTS BELATEDLY SEEM TO BE RECOGNIZING THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION
THEY MET YESTERDAY IN WASHINGTON TO REVIEW THEIR POSITION
IT SURPRISED PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN JUST HOW INTENSE THE REACTION WAS TO DOLE'S POSITION SAYS ONE OF THE SENATOR'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISERS
WHO GOT HER VOTE LAST SEPTEMBER
GEN.
BUSSI SHE SAYS
I THINK WE NEED A HARD HAND
FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
NON INTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING
PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
THAT'S A BUSINESS DECISION THAT THE MANAGER HAS TO MAKE MR. KEANE SAYS
IT'S GOING TO AFFECT HIS RETURN
AND IN THE LONG RUN THE RETURN WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE MANAGER STAYS IN HIS JOB
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
<NOISE> MR. MURRAY FORTY NINE YEARS OLD HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ASSUME THE POSTS OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE ON DECEMBER THIRTY ONE
HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN JANUARY WHEN FLEET FINANCIAL GROUP MERGED WITH NORSTAR BANCORP
FLEET NORSTAR RETAINS HEADQUARTERS IN PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND AND IN ALBANY
ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS
AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME *PREMARIN* BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP.'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF *PREMARIN* LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID *PREMARIN* ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGAN CHECKING ITS OTHER JETS FOR CRACKS <NOISE>
IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
AND SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW AND WAITING
HOURS BEFORE THE ARGUMENTS BEGIN LAWYERS AND AIDES REPRESENTING OUTSIDE INVESTORS WILL BEGIN CIRCLING
THEY WILL STAKE OUT CHOICE SEATS NEAR THE EXIT AND PLOT ESCAPE ROUTES TO NEARBY TELEPHONES
ONCE THE HEARING BEGINS THEY WILL HANG ON THE JUDGE'S EVERY WORD
A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED *AGREEMENTS* INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
JUAN CALDERA A SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD AGRICULTURAL WORKER FROM CIUDAD JUAREZ CHIHUAHUA IS OUTSIDE FREDDY'S AT ONE A. M. LOOKING FOR HIS EMPLOYER
FOR HIS AMNESTY APPLICATION MR. CALDERA NEEDS THE BOSS'S SIGNATURE TO HELP PROVE THAT HE HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR AT LEAST NINETY DAYS
ACTUALLY MR. CALDERA HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS
AMONG THE BIG BASHES THAT DIDN'T SURVIVE WAS FIRST BOSTON CORP.'S YEAR END EXTRAVAGANZA WHICH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ENTERTAINED THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED
RATHER THAN FUND AN ENCORE THE BROKERAGE FIRM CONTRIBUTED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES NEEDIEST CASES FUND AND THE COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS IN NEW YORK
SIMILARLY AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY THE DINING ROOM STAFF DID WITHOUT ITS ANNUAL PARTY AND INSTEAD GAVE A LUNCH FOR A GROUP OF HOMELESS CHILDREN
WHEN REMINDED OF THE ROLE REVERSALS IRVING'S MR. RICE SAYS THE FACT THAT THE MERGER TALK NEVER WENT FURTHER OBVIOUSLY SHOWS THERE IS NO COMMONALITY
A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. BACOT SAYS THIS A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN BANKING AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE INTERVENING YEARS
THE RELEVANCE OF THOSE COMMENTS TO TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES ISN'T VERY GREAT
MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
MEANWHILE SHARE PRICES CLOSED HIGHER IN SYDNEY HONG KONG WELLINGTON SEOUL AND MANILA AND WERE LOWER IN SINGAPORE
TRADING WAS DESCRIBED AS LIGHT TO MODERATE
THE TAIPEI MARKET WAS CLOSED
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS THE THREAT OF RAIN AND FAVORABLE SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS PUSHED SOYBEAN AND CORN FUTURES PRICES LOWER
THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
ANOTHER EXECUTIVE EXPLAINS THE PROBLEMS AS THE OPPOSITE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
LAST YEAR YOU HAD TUMULTUOUS SWINGS IN THE MARKETS THEMSELVES HE SAYS
THIS YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE NARROWER SWINGS BUT VOLUME WILL BE LOWER WITH REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
CLASS A. STOCK HAS ONE TWENTIETH OF A VOTE PER SHARE AND WILL RECEIVE AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF TEN CENTS A SHARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY
CLASS B. STOCK HAS ONE VOTE PER SHARE BUT PRESIDIO HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON THOSE SHARES
PRESIDIO HOLDERS MAY EXCHANGE THEIR CLASS B. SHARES ON A SHARE FOR SHARE BASIS THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM C- DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
JUDGE THEM ON THEIR PERSONALITY JUDGE THEM ON ANYTHING YOU WANT THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES TELLS THE CROWD
THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHREYER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING REGULATORS WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
WITH THE INITIAL FINANCING COMPLETE L. S. I. LOOKED ABROAD IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR ITS NEXT INFUSION
WE DECIDED TO GO TO INVESTORS WHO'D PAY A HIGHER PRICE EXPLAINS MR. CORRIGAN
AT THE TIME EUROPEANS WERE CLAMORING TO INVEST IN U. S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN GOOD DEALS HE SAYS
IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
TORONTO BASED P. C. L. MAKES PACKAGING AND FURNITURE
ROBERT J. TWEEDY ITS PRESIDENT SAID THE COMPANY IS LOOKING AT ITS OPTIONS BUT HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER
MR. TWEEDY AND THOMAS N. DAVIDSON CHAIRMAN OWN NINETEEN PERCENT OF P. C. L.'S FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS
TURNER OWNS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE CITRUS GROVES
F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION INCREASES ITS CITRUS ACREAGE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND
BASIC ENGINEERING DESIGN AND SITE PREPARATION STUDIES ARE TO START THIS WINTER
CONSTRUCTION IS TO START IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE PROVIDED THE PROJECT REMAINS ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE
PRODUCTION IS TO START IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX
MR. TAYLOR WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT A POST HE HAS HELD SINCE MAY ONE
HE ALSO HAS SERVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER THAT POSITION WILL BE ELIMINATED NEXT TUESDAY
PREVIOUSLY HE WAS PRESIDENT OF CIGNA'S PROPERTY CASUALTY GROUP FOR FIVE YEARS AND SERVED AS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY IN THE BUSINESS COMPLAINS ABOUT TOO MANY AWARDS AND MOST BIG AGENCIES TRY TO ENTER ONLY THE FIVE OR TEN MOST PRESTIGIOUS CONTESTS

IF YOU DON'T IT LOOKS LIKE YOU AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN COMPLAINS ROY GRACE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW YORK AGENCY GRACE AND ROTHSCHILD
YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME
CLEVELAND CONFRONTED SCANDALS SWIFTLY AND WITH UNCOMMON CANDOR CONCEDING FROM THE OUTSET FOR EXAMPLE HIS AFFAIR WITH MARIA HALPIN ONCE IT WAS EXPOSED
YET HE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO CONCEAL HIS CANCER SURGERY
MR. REAGAN ON THE OTHER HAND EXPOSED HIS MALIGNANT BOWELS TO THE NATION BUT ONLY GRUDGINGLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IRAN CONTRA FIASCO
<NOISE> MEANWHILE THE AGENCY SAID IT WILL CONDUCT A STUDY ON ITS OWN
OFFICIALS SAID THE REVIEW MAY LEAD TO NEW REGULATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS
<NOISE> THE AGENCY MAY ALSO CHALLENGE PAST CHARGES TO THE PENTAGON
PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE REVIEW LIKELY WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR
WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST
<NOISE> WE CAN'T ARGUE THAT STRONGLY FOR SPENDING BILLIONS ABROAD TO BUY DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES SAYS A VENEZUELAN OIL OFFICIAL
OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
AND THAT FIGURE DOESN'T INCLUDE GAMBLING REVENUE
<NOISE> CASINOS ARE FLUSH WITH HIGH ROLLERS WHEN A BIG FIGHT COMES TO TOWN ENABLING THEM TO RAISE MINIMUM TABLE BETS SKY HIGH
IN ATLANTIC CITY IT TOOK ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ELBOW INTO A TRUMP PLAZA CRAPS GAME THE NIGHT OF THE MICHAEL SPINKS GERRY COONEY HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT IN JUNE
MANY BLACKJACK TABLES HAD A MINIMUM BET OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
THE RESULT THE AMOUNTS WAGERED THAT MONDAY NIGHT EXCEEDED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS UP FROM ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN AVERAGE MONDAY
THE SURVEY'S COMPOSITE INDEX FELL TO FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT IN NOVEMBER FROM OCTOBER'S SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT
A FIGURE ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS GENERALLY EXPANDING
NOVEMBER MARKS THE SIXTEENTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF EXPANSION
TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEEN LOW
LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH STAGFLATION
BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY
I THINK MR.
TSAI IS PROBABLY TORN BETWEEN TWO GOALS BUILDING A WORLD CLASS FINANCIAL COMPANY AND MAKING MONEY PERSONALLY SAYS MARTIN SOSNOFF OF ATALANTA SOSNOFF CAPITAL
WHILE THE GOALS AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE HE ADDS THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ATTAINABLE AT THE SAME TIME
<NOISE> BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY CONFIRMED THAT BRITISH SECURITY FORCES KILLED THREE UNARMED IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY GUERRILLAS SUNDAY IN GIBRALTAR
<NOISE> SIR GEOFFREY HOWE SAID A TERRORIST ACT HAS BEEN AVERTED
THE THREE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN REPORTEDLY WERE PLANNING A BOMB ATTACK ON A MILITARY PARADE TODAY IN THE BRITISH COLONY
THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE
NOW THE JURY CAN CONSIDER ALMOST ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT CAME IN ABOUT DEFENDANTS' ATTEMPTS TO STONEWALL AND DENY
THE FLIPPERS APPARENTLY WAITED THE TWO WEEKS THEN DUMPED THEIR SHARES WHEN TRADING OPENED IN THE STOCK
THE FLIPPERS IN THE INDUSTRY WERE HUNGRIER TO DO THIS THAN EXPECTED AN EXECUTIVE CLOSE TO THE DEAL SAYS
THEY WERE ABLE TO BORROW MONEY
ANALYSTS SAY THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE THAT KAO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLIER U. S. ACQUISITION
LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORPORATION FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM

I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT EITHER WILLFULLY OR OTHERWISE TO EVADE INCOME TAX MR. SEOW SAID

WHY NOT FARMERS RESPOND
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THESE PRICES BEFORE SAYS DAVID GUSTAFSON AN EATON COLORADO BEAN GROWER
<NOISE> HE STILL HAS HALF OF LAST YEAR'S HARVEST IN STORAGE EVEN THOUGH HE WILL START HARVESTING THIS YEAR'S CROP THIS WEEK
<NOISE> I WANTED TO SPECULATE HE EXPLAINS
WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREED ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
WITHIN THE RULING COALITION THE LIBERAL FREE DEMOCRATS AND THE BAVARIAN SISTER PARTY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS WANT CUTS SPREAD ACROSS THE BOARD
MR. FUNARO DESCRIBED AS HOT AIR AND NONSENSE FOREIGN BANKERS' LANGUAGE IN THEIR CRITICISM OF BRAZIL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC POLICY
HE SAID NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT BRAZIL'S HIGH INFLATION WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING BIG SURPLUSES TO MEET DEBT PAYMENTS
INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR EXCUSES HE SAID THESE BANKS SHOULD REALIZE THERE'S A DEBT CRISIS AND IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY BOTH SIDES
KIDDER PEABODY WAS FINED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BY THE S. E. C. TO SETTLE INSIDER TRADING AND OTHER CHARGES
THE PENALTY IS SECOND ONLY TO IVAN BOESKY'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FINE LAST FALL
KIDDER'S SETTLEMENT THE FIRST BY A MAJOR FIRM IN THE INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL WILL ALLOW THE G. E. SUBSIDIARY TO ESCAPE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION
EVEN SO GLORIA HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP HOPE
I HEAR THAT ONLY PEOPLE WITH MONEY WILL BE APPROVED SHE SAYS
MY MOTHER TELLS HER IT ISN'T TRUE TO BE PATIENT
THE FIRM DOLLAR ALSO BOOSTED PRICES IN ZURICH AND ENCOURAGED SELECTIVE BUYING BY FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTORS DEALERS SAID
<NOISE> SOME FINANCIAL CHEMICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL STOCKS HAD THE BIGGEST GAINS
BANKS ALSO ENDED MOSTLY HIGHER
MEANWHILE MR. SILVA HERZOG BORROWED A FRIEND'S UNMARKED OFFICE IN CENTRAL MEXICO AND DISCREETLY RECEIVED VISITORS
<NOISE> HE TURNED DOWN JOB OFFERS FROM COMPANIES AND INTERNATIONAL LENDING AGENCIES BUT ACCEPTED LECTURING ENGAGEMENTS ABROAD
<NOISE> HE THOUGHT ABOUT OPENING A U. S. LATIN AMERICA STUDIES CENTER IN MEXICO CITY OR SETTING UP A CONSULTING FIRM
WHAT HAPPENS NOW
<NOISE> THAT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS WHETHER MANAGEMENT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE WORKERS AND WHETHER UNION LEADERS CAN CONTROL THE RANK AND FILE
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON EITHER COUNT
INDEED LABOR EXPERTS SAY THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE THAT SOUTH KOREA CAN LAY A FOUNDATION FOR LABOR RELATIONS THAT MIGHT CALM WORKER UNREST SOON
<NOISE> TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS

ALL THREE METALS TRADED HIGHER AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE DAY BUT LATE PROFIT TAKING TRIMMED THE ADVANCES

HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
LAWRENCE SUMMERS ECONOMIC ADVISER TO GOVERNOR DUKAKIS ARGUES THAT EVEN THE BEST FIGURES PROVIDE A DISCOURAGING PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY
<NOISE> IT USED TO BE THAT STANDARDS OF LIVING ROSE RELIABLY HE SAYS REFERRING TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES
BUT THE PACE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAS BEEN NEGATIVE BY MY PREFERRED MEASURE AND GLACIAL BY ANY OTHER
STILL THE NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTS A REMARKABLE CONCEPTUAL LEAP IN THE COMPUTER WORLD
IT IS A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCK IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUCH AS THE NEURONS IN HUMANS ARE THE VEHICLE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION
THE NETWORK HAS ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO CREATE THE FIRST CONVINCING LIKENESS OF THE BRAIN IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY AND VISION
<NOISE> DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO: THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
<NOISE> IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
BUT THIS IS A VERY LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET
THE KREMLIN WHICH LONG DENIED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL PRISONERS HERE NOW CONCEDES THEY DO EXIST
THE MOST RECENT OFFICIAL SOVIET ESTIMATES PUT THE TOTAL BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY NINE
MOSCOW DEFINES POLITICAL PRISONERS AS PEOPLE SENTENCED UNDER TWO ARTICLES OF THE SOVIET CRIMINAL CODE THAT MAKE BEHAVIOR LOOSELY DEFINED AS ANTI SOVIET A CRIMINAL OFFENSE
BOTH ARTICLES OF THE CODE WERE WIDELY USED IN LOCKING UP DISSIDENTS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
AD AGENCIES IN THE PAST HAVE TYPICALLY RECEIVED AS COMMISSIONS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF AN ADVERTISER'S BILLINGS THE TOTAL COST OF PLACING ADS
THE PURCHASED UNITS HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BILLINGS OF TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> AYER HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BILLINGS OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
CRAY ALREADY HAS SOLD TWO OF THE NEW COMPUTERS
ALL TOLD CRAY SAYS IT EXPECTS TO SELL FOUR Y. M. P.S THIS YEAR AND PERHAPS A DOZEN NEXT YEAR ABOUT AS MANY AS IT CAN BUILD

IN ADDITION BATUS IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO FILE FOR APPROVAL OF A TAKEOVER WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS IN NINE WESTERN STATES WHERE FARMERS OPERATES
APPROVAL BY ALL IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR A SUCCESSFUL TAKEOVER THE COMPANY'S WALL STREET ADVISERS HAVE SAID
IN ITS OFFER BATUS SIGNALED THAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS MAY TAKE MONTHS
IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
IF THE EXTRADITION EFFORT FAILS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT LOSES MORE THAN THE CHANCE TO PROSECUTE A KEY SUSPECT
IT ALSO COULD LOSE ACCESS TO AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST OTHER ACCUSED INDIVIDUALS
FIVE OTHER PROMINENT BRITISH BUSINESSMEN INCLUDING FORMER GUINNESS CHAIRMAN ERNEST SAUNDERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION
THE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AUDIENCE OF MOSTLY ADULTS WATCHING DOMINICK AND EUGENE WAS REMARKABLY QUIET UNTIL ONE OF THE CHARACTERS ON SCREEN PICKED UP A GUN
OH NO A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THEATER GASPED BREAKING THE SILENCE
A FEW PEOPLE GIGGLED NERVOUSLY YOU COULD TELL THEY'D BEEN THINKING THE SAME THING THEMSELVES
THEN MORE SILENCE INTERRUPTED AGAIN LATER BY A ROUND OF COMMUNAL SOBBING
IN AN AWKWARD REMINDER OF THE BOOM DAYS SHEARSON'S NEW LONDON HEADQUARTERS FACES AN ICE SKATING RINK BUILT JUST TO GIVE THE COMPLEX MORE GRANDEUR
OUTDOOR ORGAN MUSIC BLARES LAWRENCE WELK TUNES ONE DAY AS TWO BOYS SKATE ALONE ON THE ICE WITH HOCKEY STICKS
IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT A SHEARSON OFFICIAL BITTERLY REMARKS
UNDERNEATH THE SKATING RINK IS A GYMNASIUM SHEARSON IS TRYING TO SELL
FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES RETREATED ACROSS THE BOARD IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING AS THE DAY EARLIER DECLINE ON WALL STREET AND WEAKER DOLLAR PROMPTED WIDESPREAD PROFIT TAKING
BUT EQUITIES RECOVERED SOME OF THEIR EARLIER LOSSES LATE IN THE SESSION AND MOST PRICES CLOSED ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER
THE MARKET'S BULLISH MOMENTUM IS STILL INTACT TRADERS SAID CITING A FLURRY OF LATE BUY ORDERS
AFTER YESTERDAY'S VOTE MR. MULRONEY WOULDN'T SAY WHETHER HE WOULD TAKE ANY ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER EIGHT TORIES WHO VOTED AGAINST THE BILL
SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL HE SAID IT'S A FACT OF LIFE
YOU TRY AND GET UNANIMITY BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED
STATE PRE EMPTION WAS PROTESTED BY LESLIE GAINER A LOBBYIST FOR THE U. S. PUBLIC INTEREST GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS CONSUMERS
IT'S A REAL SLAP IN THE FACE OF STATE LEGISLATORS SHE SAID
SHE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT FULL DISCLOSURE ISN'T IMMEDIATELY REQUIRED IN CREDIT CARD SOLICITATIONS ON THE TELEPHONE OR IN MAGAZINES CATALOGS AND FLYERS
YET SHE PRAISED THE BILL FOR ENHANCING THE DISCLOSURE MADE IN MOST STATES
STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION PUT THIS PERSONNEL SERVICES CONCERN'S SEVENTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF B. PLUS RATED CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBT ON CREDITWATCH WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS
THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE DISCLOSURE LAST WEEK THAT INVESTMENT BANKER GIBBONS GREEN VAN AMERONGEN LIMITED PLANS A TWO STEP ACQUISITION OF A SUBSTANTIAL STAKE IN ROBERT HALF
A ROBERT HALF OFFICIAL SAID THE COMPANY IS CONVINCED THAT OUR DEBT COVERAGE WILL BE STRONG AND WE DON'T THINK THE RISKS WILL BE UNREASONABLE
MR. GREENSPAN COMPLIED
WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I GATHER IS HAPPENING HERE HE SAID
JUST WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE DAM BROKE WHICH LED US TO A RATHER SURPRISING END
<NOISE> AN UPJOHN SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY PLANNED TO MARKET ROGAINE TO WOMEN ALL ALONG
HOWEVER F. D. A. APPROVAL FOR USING THE DRUG ON MEN CAME FIRST BECAUSE UPJOHN DIDN'T TEST THE PRODUCT ON ENOUGH WOMEN INITIALLY
UPJOHN SAID IT BEGAN TESTING ROGAINE ON WOMEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ABOUT FOUR YEARS AFTER TESTS ON BALDING MEN BEGAN
BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
<NOISE> AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
<NOISE> HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
THE DOLLAR'S SLIPPAGE CAME DESPITE MORE COMMENTS FROM TREASURY SECRETARY JAMES BAKER AIMED AT SUPPORTING IT
<NOISE> IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW MR. BAKER SAID THE U. S. AND ITS TOP SIX ECONOMIC ALLIES ARE PREPARED TO ACT TO STABILIZE THE DOLLAR AROUND CURRENT LEVELS
LAST WEEK THE TREASURY SECRETARY WARNED IN A SPEECH THAT A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE U. S. CURRENCY'S VALUE COULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW CONTRACT THE PALMDALE FACILITY WILL REOPEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WITH EMPLOYMENT PEAKING AT ONE THOUSAND IN ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WILL BE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE AT ROCKWELL'S DOWNEY CALIFORNIA FACILITY
ONLY FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS IN TOTAL WILL BE CREATED
EDWARD KENNEDY A ROCKWELL SPOKESMAN SAID MANY OF THOSE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE IN PALMDALE WILL BE THOSE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING B. ONE B. AIRCRAFT
A DIGITAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE COURT ACTION DOESN'T CHANGE THE STATUS QUO
THE PART OF THE RULING THAT WAS OVERTURNED HASN'T BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE LAST JANUARY WHEN EMULEX OBTAINED THE STAY HE SAID
HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
MR. PRENDERGAST ALSO ADMIRES NOMURA'S PERSEVERANCE
<NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN CALLING ON US FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AND DIDN'T GENERATE ANY BUSINESS FOR THE FIRST TEN HE SAYS
THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THE WEALTH OF JAPAN AND THE FLOWS OF CAPITAL FROM JAPAN HAVE PAID OFF FOR THEM
PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D SIT BACK AND JUST ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS SAID EDWARD P. *NICOSKI* MARKET STRATEGIST AT PIPER JAFFRAY AND HOPWOOD INC. MINNEAPOLIS
BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME STRONG BUYING HERE
WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS BREAKING OUT OF THEIR TRADING RANGES
THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
<NOISE> I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
CHAMPION SAID ABOUT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WORKERS STRUCK ITS FIVE LUMBER AND PLYWOOD PLANTS IN THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND
STAMFORD CONNECTICUT BASED CHAMPION HAS FOURTEEN SUCH PLANTS NATIONWIDE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
THE INTERNATIONAL WOODWORKERS OF AMERICA AND THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS UNION STRUCK TWO CHAMPION MILLS WHERE THE CONTRACT RECENTLY EXPIRED ACCORDING TO A CHAMPION SPOKESMAN
<NOISE> PICKET LINES ERECTED BY THOSE STRIKERS QUICKLY CLOSED THE OTHERS WHERE CONTRACTS EITHER HAVE EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE BY JULY THIRTY FIRST HE ADDED
TOBACCO HEIRESS DORIS DUKE AGREED TO POST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NEEDED BY IMELDA MARCOS TO SECURE BAIL ON RACKETEERING CHARGES

<NOISE> HIS ARRAIGNMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED
MR. JORDAN WAS AWARDED DAMAGES OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND A PUNITIVE AWARD OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
THE JURY ALSO FOUND THAT CLAYTON UNDER MISSOURI COMMON LAW HAD BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES BECAUSE OF SELF DEALING
THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE AGREES ARTHUR CHRISTY THE FIRST SPECIAL PROSECUTOR APPOINTED UNDER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LAW
IN PAST INVESTIGATIONS HE NOTES THE FOCUS HAS BEEN QUITE NARROW
<NOISE> BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
<NOISE> SOME TIRE EXECUTIVES SUCH AS JOHN J. NEVIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FIRESTONE TIRE AND RUBBER COMPANY SAY MR. STONE UNDERSTANDS THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS
BUT MR. STONE'S UNION CRITICS AREN'T SO GENEROUS
THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN LAX ABOUT ORGANIZING NEW MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE
<NOISE> UNDER THE AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL <NOISE> YPSILANTI SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE ONE POINT NINE THREE FIVE SHARES OF TRUSTCORP COMMON FOR EACH COMMON SHARE OF YPSILANTI
<NOISE> TRUSTCORP SAID IT PLANS TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
<NOISE> YPSILANTI SAVINGS BANK HAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS
TRUSTCORP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH ASSETS OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS
CRITICS OF INDEXING CHARGE THAT THE APPROACH LACKS IMAGINATION AND AMOUNTS TO SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY
ADVOCATES REPLY THAT INDEXING MEANS LOWER MANAGEMENT FEES THAN THOSE OF ACTIVELY MANAGED BOND FUNDS
ALSO <NOISE> INDEXING IN RECENT YEARS OFTEN HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RESULTS THAN MANY ACTIVE MANAGERS
BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
<NOISE> HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
<NOISE> A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
<NOISE> IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
WHEN STOCKS ARE RISING PORTFOLIO INSURERS DON'T HEDGE AND INSTEAD RIDE THE MARKET HIGHER
WHEN STOCKS ARE FALLING PORTFOLIO INSURERS SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES IN EFFECT CUSHIONING THE VALUES OF THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS FROM THE FULL BRUNT OF A DROPPING MARKET
<NOISE> THE IDEA ACCORDING TO WALL STREET PROPONENTS <NOISE> IS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AT A LOW COST
AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
DECEMBER DELIVERY GOLD SETTLED AT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS SEVENTY CENTS FOR A DECLINE OF TWELVE DOLLARS EIGHTY CENTS
<NOISE> DECEMBER SILVER FELL THIRTY THREE POINT THREE CENTS TO SIX DOLLARS SIX FORTY FIVE
<NOISE> JANUARY PLATINUM WAS DOWN THIRTEEN DOLLARS SIXTY CENTS TO FOUR HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS FORTY CENTS
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
CAR SALES APPARENTLY HAVE LEVELED OFF AFTER DISAPPOINTING RESULTS EARLY IN THE YEAR FOLLOWED BY A SHARP UPTICK IN LATE JANUARY
BIGGER INCENTIVES FUELED THE REBOUND AND HAVE HELPED SUSTAIN THE SALES PACE
CHRYSLER CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE BOOSTED CASH REBATES TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON SOME MODELS
<NOISE> GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
<NOISE> IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
<NOISE> AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
GENERALLY THERE'S NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCH OF THEIR FUNDS EMPLOYEES CAN BORROW IF THEIR ACCOUNTS TOTAL TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS
FOR LARGER ACCOUNTS EMPLOYEES ARE RESTRICTED TO BORROWING HALF THE TOTAL BUT NO MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
<NOISE> LOANS MUST BE REPAID WITHIN FIVE YEARS UNLESS THE MONEY GOES TOWARD BUYING A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IN WHICH CASE LONGER REPAYMENT TERMS CAN BE ARRANGED
BORROWED FUNDS AREN'T TAXED
BUT A WITHDRAWAL IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME AND IS SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT PENALTY TAX
LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL
<NOISE> A SUBPOENA IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING
MR. ICAHN'S LAWYERS AT WEIL GOTSCHAL AND MANGES IN NEW YORK SAID THE INVESTIGATION HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF MR. ICAHN'S BID
BUT MR. GIBBS IS HOPEFUL THAT MANY TAXPAYERS WILL ACCEPT
<NOISE> AMONG OTHER INCENTIVES THE NEW TAX LAW PHASES OUT THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE I. R. S.
THE I. R. S. ALSO HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAX COURT CHALLENGES TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN TAX SHELTERS
WE'RE WINNING MORE THAN WE'RE LOSING THE I. R. S. CHIEF POINTS OUT
DOUBLEDAY ALSO PROVIDED BERTELSMANN WITH MUCH NEEDED U. S. BOOK MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
<NOISE> MOREOVER <NOISE> MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
<NOISE> IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER CLAIM THAT IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS NOT THE DOGS THEMSELVES ARE TO BLAME FOR THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATTACKS
THEY'RE IMMORAL SAYS AN OFFICIAL OF THE UNITED KENNEL CLUB A PRESTIGIOUS PEDIGREE ASSOCIATION
THEY'LL DO WHAT THE TRAINER ALLOWS THEM TO DO
K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS
THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID
THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
WHAT'S MORE <NOISE> A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
<NOISE> UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE
CURRENT HEMDALE HOLDERS THEN WOULD HAVE OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COMPUTER MEMORIES' SHARES
THE SURVIVING COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED HEMDALE FILM CORP. AND JOHN DALY HEMDALE'S CURRENT CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY
A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
<NOISE> WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS THE COMPANY THAT INVENTED THE OVERNIGHT EXPRESS BUSINESS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO STILL DOMINATES IT
FEDERAL EXPRESS COLLECTS MORE THAN HALF THE REVENUE IN WHAT IS NOW MORE THAN A SIX BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
AND AT A TIME WHEN DETERIORATING SERVICE IS A NATIONAL MALADY THIS COMPANY CLAIMS TO DELIVER MORE THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ITS LETTERS AND PACKAGES ON TIME
HOUSING STARTS TOTALED ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UNITS LAST YEAR UP TWENTY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
IN DECEMBER ALONE STARTS ROSE TWENTY POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE UNITS
<NOISE> THAT MARKED THE TWENTIETH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASE
EARLY FEBRUARY NORTH AMERICAN BUILT CAR SALES EDGED UP ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ACCORDING TO FIGURES REPORTED LAST WEEK
THAT TRANSLATES INTO A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATE OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION VEHICLES COMPARED WITH A SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION RATE A YEAR EARLIER
<NOISE> THIS WEEK'S MID FEBRUARY REPORT ON CAR SALES WILL TELL WHETHER THAT PACE WAS BEING MAINTAINED
OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER
<NOISE> AS PORTFOLIO STRATEGISTS PUZZLE OVER THE MARKET IMPACT OF THIS WAVE OF GOOD NEWS THEY COME UP WITH SOME SHARPLY DIVERGENT OPINIONS
<NOISE> AFTER LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
<NOISE> YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN
<NOISE> BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND
I READ HIS BOOK
MONARCH CAPITAL ROSE TWO TO FORTY ONE AND THREE QUARTERS
<NOISE> THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING ONE MILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES SAID IT WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE MILLION SHARES
MONARCH HAS ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE THIRD SECTION DISPLAYS THE DAY'S TOP NEWS FROM EQUITY CREDIT AND OTHER MARKETS IN THE U. S. AND ABROAD
YOUR MONEY MATTERS HAS BEEN MOVED TO THIS PAGE
<NOISE> ALSO APPEARING THERE ARE MARKETS DIARY AND INVESTMENT INSIGHTS TWO GRAPHIC SUMMARIES OF MARKET TRENDS
THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE DIRECTED THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT A TASK FORCE ON THE PROJECT ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
CONGRESS CHARGED THE GROUP WAS DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR THE EXPANDED USE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AS A MEAN FOR BROADENING THE CAPITAL OWNERSHIP BASE THERE
MR. REAGAN NAMED SENIOR DIPLOMAT AND FINANCIER J. WILLIAM MIDDENDORF THE SECOND THE FORMER U. S. AMBASSADOR TO THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AS CHAIRMAN
THE SYSTEM ISN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTER OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN PRIMARILY REASSURED
EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST
SALES OF BUILDING MATERIALS INCREASED ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AFTER A POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP
OVERALL SALES OF DURABLE GOODS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO LAST THREE YEARS OR MORE FELL POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER RISING THREE POINT ONE PERCENT IN AUGUST
MERRILL'S STOCK ROSE THREE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO TWENTY NINE AND THREE EIGHTHS
L. F. ROTHSCHILD HOLDINGS ROSE ONE AND THREE QUARTERS TO EIGHT AND THREE EIGHTHS
THE FIRM'S CO CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAID IT IS MEETING ALL OF ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
SALOMON INCORPORATED ROSE THREE TO TWENTY FIVE E. F. HUTTON GAINED ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PAINEWEBBER ADDED ONE TO EIGHTEEN AND AND A QUARTER
THE BILL IF IT BECOMES LAW WOULD BAR HOSTILE ACQUIRERS FROM MERGING THEIR TARGETS FOR THREE YEARS AFTER AN OFFER IS LAUNCHED EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
THE DELAWARE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE LEGISLATION TUESDAY
THE SENATE IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE IT TODAY
ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN INTERNATIONAL STOCK PICKERS JOHN TEMPLETON NEARLY EQUALED THE INDEX WITHOUT ANY JAPANESE STOCKS IN HIS SMALL TEMPLETON FOREIGN FUND
HE DID SO VIA WINNING BETS IN SUCH MARKETS AS MEXICO CANADA AND BRITAIN
WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE HE SAID
HIS LARGER FUNDS WHICH CAN INCLUDE U. S. STOCKS DIDN'T FARE AS WELL
TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE
THE NETWORKS HAVE BEGUN THE DELICATE CRAFT OF SPINNING THE NUMBERS TO THEIR BENEFIT AND OF PUTTING THE BEST SHINE ON A DISMAL TELEVISION SEASON
C. B. S. HELD A NEWS BRIEFING LAST FRIDAY
A. B. C. HOSTS ONE TODAY N. B. C. WILL DO SO TOMORROW
SOME RULES GOVERNING THE ABILITY TO STAY IN BUSINESS TAKES EFFECT FRIDAY
BUT PROFESSOR PENNINGTON SAYS IT WILL BE TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE BUSINESSES BEGIN TO LOSE THEIR AUTHORIZATION
REGULATORS HE SAYS CAN'T BE TOO HARD ON PEOPLE WHO JUSTIFIABLY CLAIM THEY HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO COMPLY
ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED HE SAYS
WE HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS THAN WE DID BEFORE
HE'S PLANNING ON SPENDING SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION THIS YEAR COMPARED WITH A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST
CONDOM SALES FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED IN APRIL
CARTER WALLACE'S SHARE AMOUNTS TO OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET
MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS A CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
AS A RESULT THE SEQUOIA WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE U. S. NAVY THIS YEAR
OR PERHAPS ANY YEAR
AND THE SHIP WHICH WAS USED BY EIGHT U. S. PRESIDENTS MIGHT EVEN GO UNDER
THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED THE CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
CONGRESS STILL HAS COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
IN RECENT MONTHS SPICER HAS CUT ITS ONE THOUSAND MEMBER U. S. STAFF BY TEN PERCENT IN AN EFFORT TO CUT COSTS
MR. BERNSTEIN SAID THAT A MERGER OF THE TWO FIRMS WORLD WIDE WOULD CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE
WE BELIEVE SPICER IS A VERY GOOD NICHE FIRM BUT OUR MERGER DISCUSSIONS ARE VERY EARLY AT THIS POINT HE SAID
IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
IT'S ABOUT AS INTERESTING AS YESTERDAY'S TUNA FISH SAID MARYANN KELLER AN AUTO ANALYST WITH FURMAN SELZ MAGER DIETZ AND BIRNEY
THE JAPANESE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HECK OF A TIME SELLING TWO POINT THREE MILLION CARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
I'M NOT SURE HOLDING QUOTAS DOES THEM ANY HARM
MS. BASS WON'T DISCUSS STRATEGY FOR I. MAGNIN
BUT INDUSTRY OBSERVERS SAY I. MAGNIN LIKE OTHER RETAILERS IN TODAY'S SATURATED MARKETS WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A MORE FOCUSED IDENTITY
MS. BASS ALSO WILL HAVE TO REASSESS THE VALUE OF SOME OF ITS SCATTERED STORES INCLUDING THOSE IN CHICAGO WASHINGTON AND ARIZONA AND INCREASE SALES VOLUME
THAT'S THE ONLY CURE SAYS MARK SHULMAN PRESIDENT OF LIMITED INCORPORATED'S HENRI BENDEL AND A FORMER EXECUTIVE AT I. MAGNIN AND BLOOMINGDALE'S
WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREE ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS FOR ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
WITHIN THE RULING COALITION THE LIBERAL FREE DEMOCRATS AND THE BAVARIAN SISTER PARTY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS WANT CUTS SPREAD ACROSS THE BOARD
HIS ANSWER RAISE THE TEMPERATURE ARTIFICIALLY IN THE MORNING BY JOGGING OR WITH A HOT DRINK
BREAKFAST ALSO HELPS AS DOES JUMPING INTO A HOT SHOWER ON AWAKENING
AT THE OPPOSITE END MORNING PEOPLE TAKE NAPS
A FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTE NAP AT TWO OR THREE P. M. WILL GIVE THEM MORE ENERGY
MR. WALSH'S LEGAL THEORY ABOUT THE FLOW OF FUNDS IS LIKELY TO BE THE LINCHPIN OF AN EFFORT TO BRING BROADER CONSPIRACY AND OTHER CRIMINAL CHARGES
CENTRAL TARGETS OF THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN POINDEXTER FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE OLIVER NORTH AND RETIRED AIR FORCE MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD SECORD
A FINAL DECISION ON SEEKING CHARGES COULD COME IN SEPTEMBER
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
THE *SUBSIDY* FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
REMEMBER THE ONE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BANKER
IT WAS A WIDELY TOLD CIRCA OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND WENT LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU CALL AN INVESTMENT BANKER
HEY WAITER
HARDLINERS FOR INSTANCE WANT A LAW THAT BANS ALL OBSCENE AND INDECENT SPEECH OVER THE TELEPHONE
THE BATTLE SHOULD BE CARRIED TO THE SUPREME COURT ARGUES REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM DANNEMEYER A CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN
DIAL A PORN HE SAYS MOVES SEXUALITY FROM THE HUMAN LEVEL TO THE ANIMAL LEVEL
THESE ARE VERY INTERESTING TIMES SAYS RICHARD SHAFFER AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT AND ANALYST WHO PUBLISHES TECHNOLOGIC COMPUTER LETTER
A YEAR AGO IT SEEMED THAT I. B. M. AND MICROSOFT ALONE WOULD DICTATE THE STANDARDS FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS IN THE OFFICE
NOW AFTER APPLE'S LAWSUIT CHALLENGING MICROSOFT AND SUN COMING UP WITH OPEN LOOK FOR UNIX WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING THREE VERY COMPETITIVE STANDARDS
THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES MAGAZINES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN OFF LIMITS TO ALL ADVERTISERS
BUT RECENTLY THE ARMY AND NAVY CONSIDERED FARMING THEIRS OUT TO COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS WHO WOULD ACCEPT ADS
WE'RE EXPLORING IT TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY WE COULD SAVE ON OUR SOLDIERS MAGAZINE AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAYS
ALL THIS REFLECTS A MOOD OF TRANSITION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT HAS GRIPPED BRITAIN'S PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED THEATER IN RECENT YEARS

A CLIENT YESTERDAY WHO BOUGHT A NEW CAR COULDN'T DRIVE IT OFF THE LOT HE SAYS BECAUSE HE WAS UNABLE TO INSURE IT
MR. MARTENS SAID VITRO WASN'T PREPARED TO AGREE TO THAT CONDITION
HE SAID APPARENTLY ANCHOR IS CONCERNED THAT THE INFORMATION IT IS OFFERING TO PROVIDE WILL GIVE VITRO A BASIS FOR LOWERING THE PRICE
INDEED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY ANCHOR GIVE VITRO A BASIS TO LOWER THE BID
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGAN CHECKING ITS OTHER JETS FOR CRACKS
IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT TODAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
MEANWHILE THE AGENCY SAID IT WILL CONDUCT A STUDY OF ITS OWN
OFFICIALS SAID THE REVIEW MAY LEAD TO NEW REGULATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS
THE AGENCY MAY ALSO CHALLENGE PAST CHARGES TO THE PENTAGON
PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE REVIEW LIKELY WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR
IT'S THE LIFE OF A ENTREPRENEUR AND THE FATE OF CREATIVITY IN A MODERN FINANCIALLY ORIENTED AMERICA MR. LUCAS SAYS WARMING TO THE SUBJECT
IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A SOCIETY WHEN IT GROWS OLD AND TRIES TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO INSTEAD OF LETTING ITS MORE CREATIVE INSTINCTS TAKE OVER
ALTHOUGH TUCKER IS SET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MR. LUCAS MAKES IT CLEAR HE THINKS THE FILM'S SUBJECT IS CURRENT AND QUITE PERSONAL
BULLION DEALERS SAY THE FIVE HOUSES FIXING THE GOLD PRICE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET AND REQUIREMENTS OF BRITISH FINANCIAL LEGISLATION
AS A GROUP THE FIVE BULLION FIRMS TRANSACT LESS BUSINESS THAN OUTSIDE MARKET MAKERS SEVERAL LONDON BULLION TRADERS SAY
UNLIKE GOLD FUTURES MARKETS IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO HOWEVER THE LONDON GOLD MARKET DOESN'T PUBLISH TRADING STATISTICS
SABOTEURS ARE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM SAYS MR. CAIRO REFERRING TO THE BEVY OF PEOPLE WHO SHIELD THE DEBTOR
AT THE OFFICE THE COLLECTOR'S NATURAL ENEMIES ARE SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS AND SECRETARIES SO MR. CAIRO ADVISES CALLING THE DEBTOR BEFORE NINE AFTER FIVE AND DURING LUNCH
AT THAT TIME THE PREY HIMSELF MAY ANSWER
THE OPPOSITION IS ALREADY ROLLING
MANY OF THE PRESSURE GROUPS THAT CAMPAIGNED UNSUCCESSFULLY AGAINST MR. REAGAN IN TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS SEEM TO REGARD THIS BATTLE AS THEIR ARMAGEDDON
TEDDY KENNEDY HIMSELF HAS TESTIFIED THAT JUDGE BORK'S APPEARANCE MEANS THE END IS NEAR
IF RONALD REAGAN WANTS ROBERT BORK CONFIRMED HE WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE CHOICE TO THE ONE THESE GROUPS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON UNDECIDED SENATORS
THAT MEANS MR. REAGAN HAS TO EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHY AMERICAN SOCIETY WILL BENEFIT IF JUDGES SUCH AS ROBERT BORK APPLY THE LAW IN A NEUTRAL MANNER
HE WILL HAVE TO POINT OUT WHY MANY OF THE LONG HELD GRIEVANCES OF ELECTORATE RESULT WHEN UNELECTED JUDGES MANUFACTURE NEW LAWS
<NOISE> MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
LOST WAGES SOME ECONOMISTS ARE DISMAYED AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO DROP THE HOURLY EARNINGS INDEX FROM ITS MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT NEXT YEAR
IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAYS MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
ECONOMISTS SAY THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
NEWSPAPER COSTS ARE UP SHARPLY THIS YEAR LARGELY BECAUSE OF HIGHER NEWSPRINT PRICES THE INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST COST BEHIND LABOR EXPENSES
SINCE OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX PRICES HAVE RISEN THREE TIMES BY A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT
NEWSPAPERS HAVE RESPONDED BY USING LIGHTER WEIGHT PAPER TRIMMING PAGE SIZE AND CUTTING THE SPACE FOR NEWS
MEANWHILE CIVIL R. I. C. O. CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES
FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS WHO CONSULTED ME HAD SUBMITTED THE LOW BID FOR A LARGE MARINA TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON LAKE MICHIGAN
THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL R. I. C. O. ACTION CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD
NO MATTER WHAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUIT THE LOW BIDDERS HAVE ALREADY FELT THE STING OF SUCH POISONOUS WORDS AS RACKETEER
FEDERAL FUNDS NINE PERCENT HIGH EIGHT AND THREE QUARTERS PERCENT LOW EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS PERCENT NEAR CLOSING BID EIGHT AND FIFTEEN SIXTEENTHS PERCENT OFFERED
RESERVES TRADED AMONG COMMERCIAL BANKS FOR OVERNIGHT USE IN AMOUNTS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE
SOURCE FULTON PREBON U. S. A. INCORPORATED
ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
MR. JOYNES WILL OVERSEE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING UNITS AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES THE COMPANY SAID
THE SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T COMMENT AS TO WHETHER MR. JOYNES MIGHT SUCCEED MR. DAY AS CHAIRMAN
MR. DAY MUST RETIRE AT AGE SIXTY FIVE
UNDER THE FEDERAL RAILWAY LABOR ACT THE REJECTION TRIGGERED A THIRTY DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT STARTED YESTERDAY
IF AMERICAN AND ITS UNION CAN'T REACH A SETTLEMENT BY THEN THE AIRLINE CAN IMPOSE ITS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER OR LOCK OUT ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ALSO WOULD BE FREE TO STRIKE BUT IT HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO DO SO
THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
<NOISE> ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER PHIL DILEO MR. KELLNER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST MONEYMAKERS
KELLNER DILEO STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH ONLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND REPORTEDLY HAS HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL GAINS OF SIXTY PERCENT BEFORE PAYOUTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS
LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE
DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND ONE QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF
AND IT SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER
MR. BRODY WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
A LEBANESE NEWSPAPER PREDICTED THAT FOUR COLLEGE TEACHERS THREE AMERICANS AND AN INDIAN RESIDENT OF THE U. S. WOULD BE FREED SOON
THE FOUR HAVE BEEN HELD HOSTAGE SINCE JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND ARE BELIEVED TO BE IN BEIRUT'S SOUTHERN SLUMS
SYRIA HAS SENT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SOLDIERS TO THE AREA TO END FIGHTING BETWEEN RIVAL SHIITE MILITIAS
WALL STREET ANALYSTS LOOK TO THE INTEREST IN HOUSTON BASED ENRON CORPORATION'S OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS AS A GAUGE OF LIKELY INTEREST IN TENNECO'S PROPERTIES
IN LATE APRIL ENRON AN INTEGRATED NATURAL GAS CONCERN PUT OIL AND GAS ASSETS UP FOR SALE
ANALYSTS VALUED THOSE PROPERTIES AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND ONE SAID ENRON HAS RECEIVED ABOUT TWENTY OFFERS
ENRON WOULDN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF OFFERS
MANY PEOPLE CRITICIZED ADS THAT GLORIFY JUNK
SOME SINGLED OUT AS CONTRADICTORY A COOKING OIL AD TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO CUT DOWN ON CHOLESTEROL BUT FEATURING FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES
IT'S ALSO DISHONEST SOME SAID TO OMIT INFORMATION OR HIDE IT IN SMALL PRINT
THEY NOTED THAT ADS FOR HIGH FIBER CEREALS NEGLECT TO MENTION THEIR SALT AND SUGAR CONTENT
I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID
BIDS WERE DOWN A QUARTER TO A HALF A POINT AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK
IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT <NOISE> IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK
HE ALSO WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO NINETY MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS OR NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS IN NINETY DAYS
HE DID SO WITH ENTHUSIASM HE DROPPED DRUG USING FRIENDS AND IT SEEMED OUR TROUBLES SOON WOULD BE BEHIND US
BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON
<NOISE> BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS
<NOISE> IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT ONE EIGHT TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE
THE DECLINE SNAPPED A STRING OF FIVE RECORD CLOSINGS
<NOISE> THE STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX FELL TWELVE POINT NINE TWO POINTS TO EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN POINT SIXTY NINE
VOLUME TOTALED ABOUT ONE BILLION SHARES
PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT CHUN HAS CHOSEN ROH TAE WOO HEAD OF THE RULING PARTY TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR WHEN CHUN'S TERM ENDS IN FEBRUARY
THE NOMINATION WHICH ENDED MONTHS OF SPECULATION ABOUT SUCCESSION MEANS ROH IS CERTAIN TO BE NAMED NEXT WEEK AS THE DEMOCRATIC JUSTICE PARTY'S CANDIDATE
HIS ELECTION IS ALMOST GUARANTEED
SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT
BUT ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PREFER SUCH A PLAN BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN CURTAILING THE COMPANY'S AMBITIOUS STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM
IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT A SMALL GROUP OF INVESTORS ACQUIRES A COMPANY IN A TRANSACTION FINANCED LARGELY WITH BORROWING
ULTIMATELY THE DEBT IS PAID WITH FUNDS GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S OPERATIONS OR THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS
PEOPLE HE POINTS OUT COME TO HIM NOW
THEY KNOW JESSE CAN DELIVER
THE BOTTOM LINE IS BECOMING IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR CHILDREN GET JESSE
IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO STAND WITH YOU AT A FARM AUCTION OR STAND WITH YOU AT A CLOSED FACTORY GATE GET JESSE
IT'S A REPUTATION WITH A GROWING CREDIBILITY TO IT
A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
PRICES ON THE UPSCALE ACURA DIVISION'S BASE MODEL CARS JUMPED EVEN HIGHER THAN THE HONDA DIVISION'S PRICES
THE ACURA INTEGRA JUMPED THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT OR THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS TO TEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS
THE LUXURY LEGEND SEDAN INCREASED IN PRICE TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT OR FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS
AND THE LEGEND COUPE ROSE TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT OR FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS
MR. PERONI AGREED THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY IS A POSITIVE FACTOR FOR STOCK PRICES
THE BETTER BEHAVIOR OF THE DOLLAR IS A BIG INCENTIVE FOR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS TO STICK BOTH FEET IN THE WATER HE SAID
HE PREDICTED THAT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS COULD BE AS HIGH AS THE UPPER TWENTY TWO HUNDREDS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER
HOWEVER JOHN MENDELSON CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS BELIEVES SUCH A SLUMP COULD HAPPEN
I THINK YOU WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL TURNOVER LEVELS IN A BEAR MARKET
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO SEE A REAL DULL LOUSY MARKET
TURNOVER LEVEL THAT YEAR SIXTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT
THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SPECIALTY RETAILING TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON SEARS'S BOTTOM LINE
SEARS'S MERCHANDISE GROUP ALONE GENERATED PROFIT OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT
HOWEVER A SEARS SPOKESWOMAN SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE ANY QUALIFICATIONS ABOUT HOW QUICKLY OR HOW MUCH SPECIALTY ACQUISITIONS WOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO EARNINGS
DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES INCORPORATED IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR EIGHT PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT NINETY NINE AND ONE QUARTER
<NOISE> SEPARATELY ITS DILLARD INVESTMENT COMPANY UNIT IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SEVEN AND THREE EIGHTHS PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT PAR
BOTH NOTE ISSUES WILL PAY ACCRUED INTEREST FROM LAST THURSDAY
BOTH OFFERINGS ARE BEING UNDERWRITTEN BY GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY AND AREN'T REDEEMABLE BEFORE MATURITY
THE LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS BASED RETAILER SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO RETIRE DEBT TO FINANCE OPERATIONS AND FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES
THE INVESTMENT UNIT SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO BUY CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE GROWING OUT OF THE PARENT'S RETAIL SALES
<NOISE> PROCEEDS MAY ALSO BE USED TO RETIRE SHORT TERM BORROWINGS THE UNIT SAID
CHRYSLER SAID RECENT PRODUCTION DECLINES ARE RELATED TO THE CLOSING OF A NUMBER OF PLANTS FOR CONVERSION
AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THE COMPANY'S BELVIDERE ILLINOIS CAR ASSEMBLY PLANT IS CLOSED FOR AN EIGHTEEN WEEK PLANT CONVERSION
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED HOURLY WORKERS ARE ON TEMPORARY LAYOFF AS A RESULT OF THE CLOSING CHRYSLER SAID
LAST SEPTEMBER H. B. O. REJECTED A THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION OFFER FROM ANDOVER GROUP
IN MARCH ANDOVER SAID IT WOULD SEEK TO ELECT ITS OWN SLATE OF DIRECTORS AT THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL MEETING THEN SCHEDULED FOR APRIL THIRTIETH
CITING THE CREATION OF A SPECIAL DIRECTORS COMMITTEE TO STUDY FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES H. B. O. ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH POSTPONED THE ANNUAL MEETING
THE COMPANY DIDN'T ANNOUNCE THE VOTES OF THE APRIL THIRTIETH PROXY VOTE
NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY RESTRUCTURING CANDIDATE
ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS
BUT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVING BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ASSET VALUES HAVE CHANGED THAT
T. P. A. REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENT DEATHS BY FIFTY ONE PERCENT IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER HEART ATTACK
OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PATIENTS WHO WERE GIVEN T. P. A. TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DIED IN THAT PERIOD
OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
THESE DAYS REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL SAYS CONGRESSIONAL POWER IS MUCH MORE DIFFUSE
NO SINGLE MEMBER NOT EVEN A VETERAN CHAIRMAN LIKE HIMSELF CAN ACT WITH THE IMPUNITY OF THE BARONS OF OLD
THE ORDINARY MEMBERS HAVE ACHIEVED MUCH MORE POWER THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTION HE SAYS
TODAY THE CHAIRMEN ARE NET LOSERS
THE TIGERS DON'T LIKE TO STRESS THE SOURCE OF THEIR BASEBALL PROWESS
THE TEAM'S PRESS RELEASES SAY THE TEAM HAS ENGLISH BORN AND BRED PLAYERS
UNDER QUESTIONING IN THE STADIUM PUB MR. HUNT ADMITS TO HAVING RECRUITED A DUTCHMAN A PAKISTANI AND AN AMERICAN THIRD BASEMAN
AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK
BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS LUCRATIVE FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA
BRITISH AIRWAYS GAVE UP ONLY A FEW ROUTES FROM GATWICK TO EUROPEAN CITIES WHICH IN MOST CASES IT ALREADY SERVED FROM HEATHROW
PRICES OF SOME ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR BONDS ROSE ONE QUARTER POINT OR TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
THE YIELD HOVERED AT NINE POINT OH THREE PERCENT
RATES ON TREASURY BILLS AND OTHER MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS EDGED LOWER WHILE CORPORATE MUNICIPAL AND MORTGAGE BOND PRICES EASED SLIGHTLY
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE
ANNUAL GROWTH OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT AND GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
MR. BUCHI BELIEVES SUCH GROWTH CAN BE SUSTAINED
SOUTH AFRICA ANGOLA AND CUBA ENDED A ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT OR A DATE TO MEET AGAIN
BUT SOURCES SAID THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH INVOLVE NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PEACE IN ANGOLA HAVE MADE PROGRESS
APPARENTLY THE THREE NATIONS ARE FOCUSING ON A U. S. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD GET CUBAN TROOPS OUT OF ANGOLA IN TWO YEARS
STOCK EXCHANGES COMMODITY MARKETS MANY BANKS AND SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE U. S. MONDAY IN OBSERVANCE OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
FEDERAL OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY REGULAR MAIL DELIVERIES
MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ALSO WILL BE CLOSED
TO HELP BOOST SALES FORD HAS SENT OUT LETTERS TO DEALERS TOUTING THE AIR BAG
ITS SAFETY DIRECTOR ALSO SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS VISITING DEALERS AND PROMOTING THE DEVICE
THE FORD SPOKESMAN SAID THIS LATEST INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE CUSTOMERS' PERCEIVED VALUE OF THE AIR BAGS
U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EARLIER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
THOUGH THERE ISN'T A CURE FOR AIDS PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE CAN BE OFFERED TREATMENTS TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES
FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN TAKE MEDICATION TO PREVENT CATCHING THE KIND OF PNEUMONIA THAT MOST COMMONLY LEADS TO THE DEATH OF AIDS SUFFERERS
AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED AIDS CAN TAKE STEPS TO GUARD AGAINST OTHER DISEASES SUCH AS HERPES AND HEPATITIS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO ACCELERATE ITS ONSET
BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISK PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING
NO LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS CAN MAKE A NUCLEAR FACILITY SAFE UNLESS IT HAS GOOD MANAGEMENT THE N. C. R. TOLD CONGRESS LAST YEAR
INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS
IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF ITS PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS
IN ADDITION TO A LARGE FUEL LOAD FOR THE FLIGHT TO PHOENIX ARIZONA THE FLIGHT WAS JAMMED WITH PASSENGERS
THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE PEOPLE ON A PLANE WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE PASSENGER SEATS
THE EXTRAS INCLUDED SIX CREW MEMBERS TWO BABIES WHO WERE BEING HELD BY PASSENGERS AND TWO NORTHWEST EMPLOYEES RIDING ON TWO OF THE PLANE'S JUMP SEATS
<NOISE> WIRE SERVICE REPORTS SAID TWO PERSONS ON THE GROUND ALSO WERE KILLED AND THAT A FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL WAS HOSPITALIZED IN CRITICAL CONDITION
LATE LAST NIGHT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED THAT THE GIRL WAS IDENTIFIED BY HER GRANDFATHER
HER FATHER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE PASSENGERS ON THE NORTHWEST AIRLINER AND DIED IN THE CRASH
D. D. C. CAUSES A PERIPHERAL *NEUROPATHY* TINGLING NUMBING AND PAIN PRINCIPALLY IN THE FEET THAT CAN REQUIRE POTENT PAINKILLERS SUCH AS MORPHINE
IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER SUCH SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE REVERSED DOCTOR SOO SAID
WHILE AIDS ALSO CAUSES SOME *NEUROPATHY* INCLUDING BOTH DISCOMFORT AND WEAKNESS IN THE HANDS AND FEET THE DRUG'S WORST SIDE EFFECT IS THE FOOT PAIN
DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
I COME WITH NO BAGGAGE WITH NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT THE BEST REGULATORY METHOD OR THE BEST WAY THE MARKET SHOULD OPERATE
I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
FOR THE NINE MONTHS NET INCREASED TO ABOUT SIX MILLION OR FIFTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM THREE POINT FIVE MILLION A YEAR EARLIER
NINE MONTH NET A YEAR AGO INCLUDED FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF SPECIAL ITEMS
SALES NEARLY DOUBLED TO ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION FROM NINETY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION
ALL SEVEN REGIONAL BELLS HAVE VOWED TO APPEAL THE DECEMBER THREE RULING BY JUDGE HAROLD GREENE THAT FORBIDS THEM TO DESIGN FABRICATE OR ASSEMBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT
OF COURSE IF THE APPEAL FAILS MANY VENTURES COULD BE JEOPARDIZED OR SCRATCHED
BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
BUT EXXON CORPORATION *AMOCO* CORPORATION AND *ATLANTIC* RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
WHILE CAMPBELL IS CONFIDENT ITS MICROWAVE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LURE NEW CONSUMERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAMPLED A FROZEN BREAKFAST OTHER COMPETITORS ARE WAFFLING <NOISE>
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM MICROWAVE WAFFLES SAID A SPOKESMAN AT I. C. INDUSTRIES
BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT THE TOASTER WAFFLES THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IN THIRTY SECONDS ARE MORE CONVENIENT AND BETTER QUALITY
A LORIMAR SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT MR. ADELSON AGREED TO BUY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND SHARES OF LORIMAR STOCK FROM MR. GARIN
THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN MESSRS.
ADELSON AND GARIN WAS ARRANGED BEFORE DISCUSSIONS RESUMED WITH WARNER
THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS
STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
<NOISE> WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WANT TO USE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GIVE LABOR THINGS IT NOW HAS DIFFICULTY WINNING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE
CONGRESS GETS CREDIT FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYERS FOOT THE BILL
J. P.
MORGAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HERO OF MINE MR. FARKAS SAYS
OF COURSE HE QUICKLY ADDS I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A ROBBER BARON IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM
THE SENATE APPROVED A NINE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL FOR *FISCAL* NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WAS AMENDED TO REQUIRE IMMIGRANTS TO UNDERGO AIDS TESTING
IT WAS PASSED SEVENTY ONE TO TWENTY THREE
THE AMENDMENT WAS THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR MANDATORY SCREENING FOR THE DISEASE
THE ORANGE BOWL BUILT IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE IS FALLING APART
AT ONE GAME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE CONCRETE CHIPS FROM THE UPPER DECK RAINED ON THE CROWD
BUT MIAMI VOTERS THREE TIMES REJECTED BOND ISSUES <NOISE> FOR REPAIRS AND OFFICIALS STRUNG MR. ROBBIE ALONG FOR YEARS WITHOUT MAKING IMPROVEMENTS CITING THE EXPENSE
WHEN HE THREATENED TO BUILD HIS OWN STADIUM HE RECALLS THE OFFICIALS ROLLED THEIR EYES AND SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE
NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN *LIECHTENSTEIN* PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
NON INTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING
IAN CAMPBELL AN ATLANTA SECOND GRADER DID JUST THAT LAST MONTH TAKING TOP HONORS IN THE CATEGORY FOR THE BEST NEW DESIGN
HIS APPROACH JUST MAKE SOMETHING UP
IF IT FLIES IT WORKS
MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
MOTIVES ARE MIXED
SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT
THE GANGS ARE EVEN BECOMING ADEPT AT THEIR OWN SORT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS
THEY BUY FOOD FOR THE ELDERLY AND SNEAKERS FOR KIDS MAKING WARY ALLIES OF BOTH
THEY SPONSOR PICNICS WHERE THEY PUT UP HUGE BANNERS FLAUNTING THEIR NAMES AND COLORS
<NOISE> MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
WE'D LOVE TO BUY THOSE HATS IN AMERICA MR. *KOSYAKOV* SAYS
<NOISE> HE WOULD ALSO LOVE TO GET CLEARANCE TO BUY AND CARRY GUNS
IT'S A NECESSITY
WE ARE NEGOTIATING THAT

A LIMITED STRIKE TARGETED AT KEY PLANTS A STRATEGY THAT U. A. W. USED FOR A WEEK AGAINST G. M. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BUFFER THE IMPACT
A STRIKE AGAINST A SECOND COMPANY IN CANADA WHERE THE CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS UNION IS BARGAINING INDEPENDENTLY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME COULD BROADEN THE DAMAGE
THE C. A. W. HAS INDICATED IT WILL TARGET A DIFFERENT AUTO MAKER THAN THE U. A. W. AND IT HAS A WIDER SELECTION

THE THIRD WORLD DEBT PROBLEM MOREOVER WAS RELATIVELY STABLE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
THE HIGH INTEREST RATES PRODUCED BY MR. VOLCKER'S TIGHT MONEY IN FACT HELPED START THE PROBLEM ON ITS WAY TO A CRISIS
THE DEBT SITUATION AND WHAT HIGH INTEREST RATES AND A U. S. RECESSION MIGHT DO TO IT HAS TO BE MUCH IN MR. GREENSPAN'S MIND
MR. HEFTER OF JEFFERIES SAYS INVESTORS ARE BASICALLY PICKING SOME STOCKS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SITUATIONS GOING THAT THEY HAVE A DEFINITE IDEA ABOUT

THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS JUSTIFIED MAINTAINED ROBERT BURGER CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER GIVEN THE GROWING DIFFICULTY IN LAUNCHING MODELS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FIELD

JUST HOW FAR AIRBUS WANTS TO TAKE COLLABORATION TALKS REMAINS UNCLEAR
THE U. S. FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS HAS BEEN CALLING FOR AN END TO AIRBUS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND IS THREATENING A TRADE WAR OVER THE ISSUE

THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
THIS IS THE FIRST TEST FOR MR. RUDER'S ABILITY TO ADJUDICATE BETWEEN THE AGENCY'S PROSECUTORS AND ECONOMISTS WHICH CAN BE A FULL TIME JOB
AS USUAL IN THE RECENT PAST THE ECONOMISTS HAVE THE BETTER ARGUMENT HERE
THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO OUTLAW THE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF SHARES IN ANY CASE AND ESPECIALLY NOT WHERE NONPROFESSIONAL SHAREHOLDERS ARE THE BIG WINNERS
THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS EACH

ANOTHER BAROMETER OF THE ECONOMY'S FUTURE COURSE CALLED THE LONG LEADING COMPOSITE IS COMPILED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CYCLE RESEARCH
<NOISE> THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE HAS SIGNALED RECESSIONS ON THE AVERAGE BY FOURTEEN MONTHS A SOMEWHAT LONGER LEAD TIME THAN FOR THE COM- COMMERCE INDEX

COMPUTERVISION THE PIONEER IN THE COMPUTERIZED DESIGN MARKET HAS HAD POOR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN RECENT YEARS AS IT REVAMPED ITS AGED PRODUCT LINE
HOWEVER RECENTLY IT HAS REPORTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED EARNINGS
ALTHOUGH IT HAS SLIPPED FROM FIRST TO THIRD IN SIZE IN THE INDUSTRY IT RETAINS A SUBSTANTIAL BASE OF CUSTOMERS
NINETEEN NINETY NINE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A SERVING PRESIDENT
IT IS ALL A PRESIDENT CAN DO TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS TIME FOR REFLECTION IS A LUXURY BEYOND REACH
NOR IS THERE TIME FOR A PRESIDENT TO LEARN MUCH BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE WITH WHICH HE COMES TO OFFICE
THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN WE THINK NOT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
FRENCH PRESIDENT MITTERRAND NAMED A LONGTIME SOCIALIST RIVAL MICHEL ROCARD AS PRIME MINISTER

MITTERRAND IS SEEKING TO REALIGN FRANCE AROUND THE CENTER LEFT
IMPERIAL SAYS IT HAS HAD TERRIFIC UNSOLICITED INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL FROM ALL AREAS OF PLASTICS USES
BUT THE COST OF MANUFACTURING THE NATURAL PLASTIC IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS A POUND COMPARED WITH ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE CENTS A POUND FOR CONVENTIONAL PLASTIC
HOWEVER THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS ENOUGH TO BEGIN MARKETING THE PLASTIC IN TWO TO FIVE YEARS
ANALYSTS SAY THEY EXPECT P. AND G'S MOMENTUM TO CARRY INTO NINETEEN NINETY AND BEYOND AND MANY RAISED THEIR FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY ESTIMATES

THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
THE TRASH
PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
UNLIKE MORE ECLECTIC RAIDERS MR. TRUMP HAS SO FAR STUCK TO REAL ESTATE
RESORTS HAS BIG UNDEVELOPED LAND HOLDINGS IN ATLANTIC CITY
ALLEGIS' WESTIN PLAZA HOTEL WHICH HE SEEMS TO WANT COULD BE WORTH TWICE AS MUCH IF MADE INTO CONDOMINIUMS HE SAYS
HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST
SALES OF BUILDING MATERIALS INCREASED ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AFTER A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP
OVERALL SALES OF DURABLE GOODS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO LAST THREE YEARS OR MORE FELL ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER RISING THREE POINT ONE IN AUGUST
WALL STREET IN GENERAL HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT G. M. IN RECENT WEEKS BECAUSE OF ITS NEW LABOR CONTRACT
THE THREE YEAR PACT INCLUDES A JOB SECURITY PROGRAM THAT PREVENTS LAYOFFS EXCEPT DURING A SALES DROP PREVENTS PLANT CLOSINGS AND SLOWS ATTRITION
MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE PROVISIONS WILL HAMPER G. M.'S EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE OPERATIONS AND SHED UNCOMPETITIVE PLANTS PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OPERATIONS
MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
I AM ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
YOU CAN TOO
ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY

THE INDICATED TIGHTNESS IN U. S. GASOLINE OUGHT TO PREVENT THE REFINERS' FLAT OUT PRODUCTION FROM LEADING TO A PRODUCT PRICE WAR
THE DECLINE IN CRUDE PRICES EVENTUALLY WILL END HOWEVER
OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE
AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY
BUT MR. RANDOL SUGGESTS THAT A TREND TOWARD PERMANENTLY IMPROVED REFINER MARGINS IS SUSTAINABLE
THROUGH ITS U. S. FINANCE SUBSIDIARY TOYOTA HAS ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE U. S. AND PRIVATELY PLACED MEDIUM TERM NOTES
IT HAS ALSO RAISED MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE EUROMARKETS BUT SO FAR HAS AVOIDED ISSUING STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE PUBLIC U. S. MARKET
THE SAME IS TRUE OF MOST JAPANESE COMPANIES
RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN

HE COULD BE LIKE A WALKING ELECTRODE
THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
MR. BOTHA MUST ALSO RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE EVENTS LOVED THEM
THE CITIZENS OF THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT A TERRIFIC FEELING THE WEEKEND ENGENDERED IN EVERYONE
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAS SO HAPPY THAT IT IS USING A PHOTO FROM LIBERTY WEEKEND IN ADVERTISEMENTS TO ATTRACT BUSINESS TO THE STATE
THOSE WHO WATCHED THE EVENTS ON TELEVISION MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS LOVED THEM
PEOPLE IN FIFTY ONE FOREIGN COUNTRIES ENJOYED THE EVENTS VIA TELEVISION
THE FRENCH WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE CELEBRATION THEY THANKED THE U. S. IN AN AD IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS
COMMUNIQUES ANNOUNCING COMPLETION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS WERE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NOVEMBER NINTH NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
IT IS SAD BUT TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EXTRAVAGANZAS HAVE COME TO BE CONDUCTED AMID THE SORT OF SECURITY OTHERWISE RESERVED FOR THE TRAVELS OF HEADS OF STATE
THE SWISS HOCKEY COACH WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HIS PLAYERS WERE SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW THEIR PASSES AT THE BLUE LINE WHEN THEY BACK CHECKED
HAVING THE BAR PATTERN ON MY PASS CHECKED ELECTRONICALLY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TIMES MADE ME FEEL LIKE A TOOTHPASTE CARTON LEAVING A SUPERMARKET
ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE
FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LENDING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
WITH THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AS ITS PRIME CUSTOMER TRACOR WAS HELPLESS WHEN DEFENSE SPENDING SLOWED
INTERNALLY MR. INMAN SAYS HE DISCOVERED THAT EXPENSES COULDN'T BE CUT AS EASILY AS BANKERS HAD FORECAST

MR. INMAN CALLS IT ALL PART OF MY EDUCATION
THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
IT'S SO SHUNNED THAT ALTHOUGH MOST MANAGERS GOING UP THE LADDER ARE OCCASIONALLY REQUIRED TO FIRE ONCE HAVING ASCENDED TO THE TOP THEY DELEGATE THE JOB
ANDREW SHERWOOD A NEW YORK MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT SAYS THAT ONLY ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES DO THEIR OWN FIRING
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPULSIVE BUILDERS HE SAYS
THEY LIKE ACQUIRING COMPANIES MAKING PROFITS GO UP AND RECRUITING PEOPLE
FIRING ISN'T WHAT THEY'RE EMOTIONALLY GEARED FOR
THEY FIND IT REPUGNANT
DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE
MR. AMMAN FORTY NINE YEARS OLD SAID HE BELIEVES WESTERN UNION'S DEBT AND EQUITY HOLDERS WILL SUPPORT THE RESTRUCTURING
HE ADDED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS RUNNING SHORT OF CASH
WESTERN UNION HAS SAID THAT IF ITS PLANS ARE DEFEATED IT WILL FILE FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS
SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
ANOTHER BANK TRADER ATTRIBUTES THE DOLLAR'S REBOUND TO FED OFFICIALS' INCREASED OPENNESS ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITIES
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK RIGHT NOW THE TRADER SAYS
THEY WANT PEOPLE TO RUN OUT AND SAY THE FED'S BUYING THE FED'S BUYING
THAT'S WHAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FED'S INTERVENTION THIS YEAR
DOW PRESIDENT FRANK POPOFF SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT BOTH PRICE AND VOLUME INCREASES BOLSTERED EARNINGS
THE COMPANY'S STRONG COST CONTAINMENT EFFORTS ALSO HELPED
COSTS REMAIN STABLE VOLUME HAS INCREASED AND THERE IS NO WEAKNESS APPARENT IN EITHER THE PRODUCT LINES OR GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MR. POPOFF SAID
FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
AND REVENUES SLUMP
BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS
THE ORDERS TYPICALLY BAR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF RECORDS AND DEPOSITIONS EVEN AFTER A SETTLEMENT OR VERDICT
PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS GENERALLY HAVEN'T BALKED AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PREPARE FOR THEIR TRIALS
IN THE NEW CONSUMERIST CHILE THIS IS A MAN WHO DOESN'T EVEN OWN A CAR
THE SON OF A RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER HE LIVES QUIETLY WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS IN A SMALL HOUSE IN SANTIAGO
HE PREFERS THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN TO THE WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINES
HIS TRAINING WAS AS A MINING ENGINEER NOT AS AN ECONOMIST
AMONG HIS RECENT READING THE EYE OF THE FLY
THE APPOINTMENT CONTINUED TO LANGUISH AND ON JUNE FIRST DOCTOR SULLIVAN CALLED MR. FULTON AND SUGGESTED THAT HE WITHDRAW HIS NAME FROM CONSIDERATION
DOCTOR SULLIVAN HAD CONCLUDED THAT EVEN IF HE PUSHED THE FULTON NOMINATION THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THE PRICE OF VICTORY WOULD BE TOO HIGH
HE WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE WRATH OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY MR. FULTON SAYS
BUT TEXAS AMERICAN MAY HAVE ITS PROBLEMS WITH THE PROPOSED COMBINATION OF REPUBLICBANK AND INTERFIRST
BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE ALONE THEY WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE STATE MR. GRANT ADDED
EXACTLY WHAT IMPACT THAT COMPETITION WILL HAVE IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS NOW HE SAID
EARLIER THIS FALL TANDON BORROWED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM FOOTHILL CAPITAL CORPORATION UNDER A SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT LINE OF AS MUCH AS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
ALSO A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SHORT TERM LOAN FROM XEROX CORPORATION WAS CONVERTED INTO A LONG TERM NOTE
THE NOTE IS CONVERTIBLE INTO TANDON COMMON STOCK
LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCIES OF THE U. S. AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED
BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY
AND AS THE CANADIAN UNIT RISES IT LURES MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY FROM JAPAN WHICH ADDS TO ITS STRENGTH
MR. CRUZ SAID HE HAD SET DEADLINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORMS HE WAS PROPOSING
HE SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE EXPECTED THAT THE INTEGRATION OF THE NEW REBEL ARMY WOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF JUNE
<NOISE> HE WARNED THAT HE WOULD DENOUNCE ANY EFFORT TO SIDETRACK THE REFORMS INDICATING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE REBEL ORGANIZATION IF HIS PLANS WEREN'T CARRIED OUT
TRADERS SAID FINANCIAL ISSUES PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL BANKS WERE STRONG AS WERE REAL ESTATE COMPANIES AND RETAILERS
CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL SHARES AND CONSTRUCTION AND HOUSING STOCKS GENERALLY EASED ON LATE PROFIT TAKING
EXPORT LED SHARES WERE MIXED TO WEAKER
EXCO A UNIT OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS P. L. C. IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BROKERS OF INTERBANK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSITS
UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT HOLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED

LAST JULY THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST
PAST SOCIETAL BIAS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BASIS TO JUSTIFY THE PLAN THE APPEALS COURT SAID IN AN OPINION WRITTEN BY JUDGE J. HARVIE WILKINSON THE THIRD

IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
BUT NETWORK OFFICIALS WILL SPEND MONTHS DEBATING C. B. S.'S WISDOM
IT'S TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE SAID MR. PILSON TESTILY TAKING ON REPORTERS AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE
I'M UP HERE STATING C. B. S. HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS AND N. B. C. HASN'T
AT N. B. C. MR. WATSON WAS PHILOSOPHIC IF PRAGMATIC YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A WINNER HE SAID
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AT THE SAME TIME
ONE FORMER INVESTIGATOR WHO WORKED ON THE PRESSER INVESTIGATION SAID THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL SUIT BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO DORMANT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE TEAMSTERS LEADER
THE EX LABOR DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATOR NOTED THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF REQUIRED IN A RICO CIVIL SUIT IS LESS THAN UNDER CRIMINAL STATUTES
HE SAID ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AGAINST MR. PRESSER SHOULD BE EASIER TO GAIN THROUGH PRETRIAL DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY
NOR IS THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN A MAGIC NUMBER STRESSED DOCTOR SHAW
IF WE HAD TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY COPIES WE WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND A HUNDRED AND DIFFERENT VIRUSES HE SAID
HE TERMED THE SPEED OF MUTATION EXTRAORDINARY AND COMPARED THE AIDS VIRUS WITH OTHER SWIFTLY CHANGING VIRUSES SUCH AS INFLUENZA
ANOTHER POTENTIAL POINT OF CONTENTION IS THE E. C.'S PLAN TO ALLOW THE FREE FLOW OF PEOPLE ACROSS BORDERS
SWITZERLAND ALREADY HAS ATTRACTED ONE MILLION RESIDENT ALIENS A PORTION OF ITS POPULATION GREATER THAN IN ANY E. C. STATE EXCEPT LUXEMBOURG
MOST SWISS THINK THAT IS ENOUGH AND THE COUNTRY HAS IMPOSED FOREIGN WORKER QUOTAS SO STRICT THAT SKILLED LABOR IS IN SHORT SUPPLY
YET IF SWITZERLAND CLOSES ITS DOOR TO MORE E. C. NATIONALS SWISS WHO WORK IN THE E. C. MAY FIND THEMSELVES LESS WELCOME
HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN

IN CHINA TOO THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERS CAN'T OVERCOME OUR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES

THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
<NOISE> THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
YESTERDAY MINET HOLDINGS P. L. C. SAID IT PLANNED TEN POINT FIVE MILLION CONTRIBUTION COULD RISE TO TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION

JIM POYNER AN ANALYST WITH RAUSCHER PIERCE REFSNES INC. IN DALLAS SAID THEY THE GROUP MAY RUN INTO SOME RESISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS

<NOISE> STILL MS. FREEDMAN NOTED THAT A BRIGHT FORECAST FOR HIRING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL GOOD NEWS
THE INCREASING USE OF LABOR MAY BE BECAUSE OF A TREMENDOUS BOOM IN THE OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES SHE SAID

RICHARD ROSLUND A VICE PRESIDENT OF BLOCK TRADING AT KIDDER PEABODY SAID THE FED CHAIRMAN'S REMARKS GAVE THE MARKET A REASON TO ADOPT A MORE POSITIVE OUTLOOK
PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO GRASP ON HE SAID
IT'S BEEN SUCH A PESSIMISTIC ATMOSPHERE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
ANALYSTS SAY THEY EXPECT P. AND G'S MOMENTUM TO CARRY INTO NINETEEN NINETY AND BEYOND AND MANY RAISED THEIR FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY ESTIMATES
BRENDA LEE LANDRY OF MORGAN STANLEY RAISED HER ESTIMATE TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTY FROM AN EARLIER ESTIMATE OF EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN
KIDDER'S MR. FREEDMAN AND JOSEPH KOZLOFF AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT RAISED THEIR ESTIMATES TO EIGHT DOLLARS FIFTY A SHARE FROM EIGHT DOLLARS TWENTY FIVE

FROM MR. CASEY AND MR. GATES TESTIMONY IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN HOW SPECIFIC LIEUTENANT COLONEL NORTH WAS AT THE OCTOBER LUNCHEON
CRITICS OF THE DIRECTOR HAVE ARGUED THAT HE FOLLOWED A CALCULATED PATTERN OF REMOVING HIMSELF FROM KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STAFF MEMBER WAS DOING
MR. CASEY HAS CAST HIMSELF AS TAKING ORDERS IN SOME CASES FROM THE LIEUTENANT COLONEL A SOURCE SAID
MORE GENERALLY WITHIN THE C. I. A. OPERATIVES ARE VAGUE ABOUT WHAT THEY OBSERVED OF THE PRIVATE SUPPLY NETWORK
ONE NORTH KOREAN ASSERTION DOES HAVE A CERTAIN SCARY CREDIBILITY TO IT
NORTH KOREA SAYS THAT BLOWING UP AN EXPENSIVE DAM TO FLOOD THE SOUTH WOULD BE A WASTE OF GOOD EXPLOSIVES
TO DO THE JOB WOULD TAKE A BLAST EQUIVALENT TO A NUCLEAR BOMB
BETTER TO DROP IT DIRECTLY ON SEOUL
THAT WOULD BE A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER IN DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT SAYS LI CHOONG SUNG THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE NORTH KOREAN POWER COMMISSION
FARM BANKS ACCOUNT FOR A MAJOR PORTION OF THE RISING NUMBER OF BANK FAILURES
OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT FEDERALLY INSURED BANKS THAT FAILED LAST YEAR FIFTY NINE HAD MADE MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THEIR LOANS IN AGRICULTURE
MORE THAN HALF OF THESE FARM BANKS WERE IN KANSAS IOWA MISSOURI AND NEBRASKA
<NOISE> EVEN LESS APPRECIATED IS THE TURMOIL THAT OFTEN RESULTS FOR WOMEN
WHEN HE STARTED BECOMING IMPOTENT I HAD ALL KINDS OF WORRIES AND STRANGE THOUGHTS SAYS MAGGIE A BOSTON WOMAN WHO LIVES WITH HER FIANCE
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING SOMETHING WRONG OR THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE ME OR THAT HE WAS GAY
SHE SAYS IT WAS A WONDERFUL RELIEF WHEN DOCTORS TRACED HIS PROBLEM TO NERVE DAMAGE FROM BACK SURGERY AND TREATED IT WITH A MUSCLE RELAXING DRUG
AND AMONG WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT HAS PLENTY OF SUPPORT
MANY PARTICULARLY AFRIKANERS WHO HAVE BEEN DEFENDING THEIR WAY OF LIFE FOR THREE CENTURIES STRONGLY BACK THE ARMY'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST COMMUNIST FORCES IN ANGOLA AND *NAMIBIA*
THEY ARE EQUALLY DETERMINED TO REPEL AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS TERRORISM INSIDE SOUTH AFRICA

MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
THAT IS TWO DOLLARS TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID
CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
PERHAPS THE HOOVER OVERSEERS SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THEY PONDER THE LATEST AFFRONT TO GLENN CAMPBELL NEXT WEEK
THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
THE SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
<NOISE> INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
SEPARATELY JUDGE BROWNING ISSUED A RULING ON THE AWARD OF ANY DAMAGES IN THE CASE
FOR CLAIMS IN THE FEDERAL CASE THE STANDARD OF DAMAGES IS OUT OF POCKET OR INVESTORS' LOSS ON THE BONDS
FOR WASHINGTON STATE CLAIMS THE STANDARD IS RECISSION WHICH COULD MEAN REPAYING BONDHOLDERS THEIR PURCHASE PRICE
THE DISPUTE IS A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MARKET PHILOSOPHIES
WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKETS
TOKYO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CLAIM TO FAVOR FREE MARKETS IN PRACTICE THEY OFTEN ARE LOATH TO RELINQUISH COMPLETE CONTROL ESPECIALLY IN PROMISING INDUSTRIES

CALIFORNIA HAS A BALLOT REFERENDUM THIS FALL ON LETTING BANKS SELL INSURANCE
DELAWARE CURRENTLY ALLOWS SOME SECURITIES UNDERWRITING BY STATE CHARTERED BANKS MS. SHAW NOTES AND NEW YORK HAS DEBATED A SIMILAR MOVE
THE TRASH
PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
<NOISE> THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE AFTER TAXES
IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR KODAK SAYS ALEX
BROWN ANALYST OTIS BRADLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
IT REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE

LAST WEEK SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED LAUNCHED ITS SALOMON RUSSELL GLOBAL EQUITY INDEX TRACKING THREE POINT FIVE SIX FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF EQUITIES WORLD WIDE
THREE SIMILAR MEASURES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE
LASZLO BIRINYI JUNIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR SALOMON'S EQUITY MARKET ANALYSIS GROUP SAYS WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE RELIABLE CONSISTENT INFORMATION ON GLOBAL SECURITIES
BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR
SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
ALBERT GROSS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT REFCO INCORPORATED AGREED
THE BOND MARKET WAS HELPED TEMPORARILY BY A DECLINE IN GOLD AND OTHER COMMODITY PRICES A STRENGTHENING DOLLAR AND A STOCK MARKET RALLY HE SAID
BUT I EXPECT THE DOLLAR TO CONTINUE FALLING AND THAT WILL ACCELERATE INFLATION PRESSURES
THE BEST NUMBERS ON INFLATION ARE BEHIND US
MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS
BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY
THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK
BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
MR. REAGAN'S COMMENTS DON'T REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION AGREEMENT
AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE THE PLAN SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD EITHER SIGN OR VETO THE SPECIFIC TAXES CONGRESS CHOOSES
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID BEFORE THAT IT ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROVISION ON TAKEOVERS
HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR
THERE'S A LOT OF BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS
THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS
MOBIL BASED IN NEW YORK SAID ITS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME JUMPED NINETY TWO PERCENT
THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
<NOISE> THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF REPLY
ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
WHEN MS. HIGA TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX FROZEN PIZZA WAS STILL A LONG SHOT <NOISE>
THE AVERAGE JAPANESE DIDN'T HAVE FREEZER SPACE LET ALONE AN OVEN
AND THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE TO SUPERMARKET TASTE TESTS WAS THAT CHEESE LOOKED AND TASTED LIKE SOAP SHE RECALLS
BUT SHE KEPT GOING PEDDLING HER PIZZAS TO RESTAURANTS AND FANCY HOTELS
SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
<NOISE> THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
A LOSS WASN'T UNEXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR
INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
<NOISE> THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
BUT W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
<NOISE> BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SAID MESSRS.
SHULTZ AND *SHEVARDNADZE* IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL WAS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
CANDICE *BERGEN* AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM
I OFTEN THINK OBSERVED MS. *BERGEN* THAT IF DOSTOEVSKI HAD BEEN A SINGER HE'D HAVE SOUNDED LIKE RAY CHARLES
THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS
IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWENTY PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWENTY PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE BE NO BIDS AT ALL
THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY
HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
WE'LL SEE
WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
<NOISE> THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
<NOISE> THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
<NOISE> MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY

COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION HAS ROLLED TWO CLUB CARS INTO TOWN TO ENTERTAIN DEMOCRATS

<NOISE> THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR ALTERNATES TO THIS CONVENTION
DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SET WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID
<NOISE> INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
<NOISE> GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE TOP SPOT
I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD *HYMAN* OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INC. SAYS
REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS IS USUALLY WRONG
THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLAC:E DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST
OTHER TOY MAKERS SUCH AS MATTEL INC. HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS EARLIER IN THE YEAR TO INCREASE SALES AT TIMES OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS
BUT TYCO'S DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS LAUNCH IS UNUSUAL
THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE <NOISE> FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW
NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
THE BANK OF ITALY ALSO REPORTEDLY SOLD MARKS TO BUY ITALIAN LIRE
THE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MAINLY AT DEFENDING THE SAGGING LIRA IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH EIGHT EUROPEAN CURRENCIES FLOAT WITHIN SPECIFIED LIMITS
BUT THEY ALSO HAD THE EFFECT OF HELPING THE DOLLAR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF MARKS IN THE MARKET
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT WHICH LIKE MR. KIRK RELISHES AN EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE THE OIL SPILL HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF ATTENTION
IN FACT WHEN WALL STREET LEARNED THAT THE PUBLICLY HELD COMPANY WAS HIRED TO HANDLE THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CLEANUP THE CONCERN'S STOCK SHOT UP ALMOST TEN PERCENT
YESTERDAY IN THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING ITS STOCK CLOSED AT TWELVE DOWN TWENTY FIVE CENTS

DOWN THE STREET FROM MR. SANCHEZ'S OFFICE CARLOS A GOVERNMENT MECHANIC SAYS HE GOES TO MANY PRO *NORIEGA* DEMONSTRATIONS
THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR
THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF *SUBSTANTIVE* GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT
AND A MESSAGE THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WILL BE STRONGLY DELIVERED
MR. TUCKER'S HARD HITTING CAMPAIGN HAS IN TURN APPALLED TOP UNION LEADERS WHO SAY HE HAS TARNISHED THEIR REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT'S CLEANEST ORGANIZATIONS
THE STATEMENTS OF AN UNDERCUT DEMOCRATIC UNION MAY BE IN BED WITH MANAGEMENT HURT THIS UNION SAID MR. BIEBER
I RESENT THOSE STATEMENTS
MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK HOLDINGS IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST
ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS
AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARDS THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
<NOISE> IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
<NOISE> HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAYS PAUL SUCKROW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORP.
I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKROW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GLORY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
THE TRASH
PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

WITHIN TWO HOURS DAYTON HUDSON COMMON HIT FIFTY NINE A SHARE ON THE BIG BOARD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS IN OTHER MARKETS
PEOPLE TOOK POSITIONS IN THE STOCK SIMPLY ON THE RUMOR OF A TAKEOVER BY SOMEONE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN BOESKY WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON *HUDSON* HOWEVER WERE MAD
SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE TROUT TO THE FLY
SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. ITS INVESTMENT BROKER TO FINANCE AN ACQUISITION
A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAYS HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION WHICH REQUIRES TIMEPLEX HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
AT THE MEETING SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO TWENTY MILLION FROM FIFTEEN MILLION
THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY BE USED FOR BENEFIT PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS
THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
THE U. S. OF COURSE HAS A VAST AND IN MANY PLACES EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
THE COUNCIL STUDY PUT A VALUE OF ONE TRILLION DOLLARS ON THE PARTS IT MEASURED
BUT GOVERNMENT OWNED FIXED CAPITAL SUFFERS ALONG WITH PRIVATELY OWNED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WHEN ECONOMIC POLICIES DISCOURAGE LONG TERM INVESTMENT
THE GREATEST SCOURGE OF INVESTMENT IS OF COURSE INFLATION WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUFFERED PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
USER FEES SIMPLY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE SOARING COSTS OF LOANS AND CONSTRUCTION
HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION HAD THE ADDED PROBLEM OF REDUCED YIELDS FROM GASOLINE TAXES BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENERGY SHORTAGES AND SHORTAGE ENFORCED CONSERVATION
THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT
THIS IT IS HOPED WILL HELP STOP HIGH INFLATION FROM SPIRALING INTO HYPERINFLATION
THE THINK TANK MEASURED EXPENSE RATIOS WHICH ARE A FUND'S OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS
FOR INVESTORS HIGH RATIOS ARE CLEARLY OF CONCERN
IT CUTS INTO *POTENTIAL* RETURN EVEN WHEN A FUND IS DOING WELL
AND IT LEAVES A FUND WITH LESS OF A CUSHION IN CASE PERFORMANCE SOURS
ALMOST UNNOTICED IN DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
INSTEAD WHAT SOME CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
ABOUT EIGHT MILLION OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
N. E. C. CORP. AS ONE EXAMPLE BEGAN DONATING MONEY TO M. I. T. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
ONE DONATION OF ONE MILLION WENT TO CREATE A C. AND C. SOFTWARE PROFESSORSHIP
C. AND C. IS THE N. E. C. CORPORATE SLOGAN IT STANDS FOR COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO U. S. INTELLIGENCE
THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT U. S. MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THE MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HAVE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION
EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION
SOME REPORTERS WERE MORE ORIGINAL
A PAIR FROM A LOCAL NEWSPAPER ASKED EDSEL IF HE FAVORED CASINO GAMBLING IN DETROIT A CONCEPT *HEAVILY* PROMOTED BY MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG
THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD
I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I WANT TO GET THEM OUT OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST
AND WHAT IF THE FOUNDRY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH CUMMINS'S DEMAND
MR. PATTERSON SAYS THE ENGINE COMPANY HAS BACKUP SUPPLIERS
BUT HE ADDS THAT BACKUP IS ALL OFFSHORE
PEOPLE ARE SCARED SAYS RICHARD ROSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR A *RESEARCH* ORGANIZATION IN CHICAGO
WHEN THE MARKET GOES DOWN STOP ORDERS APPEAR LIKE CRAZY HE SAYS
AND IN A VOLATILE UNCERTAIN MARKET LIKE THIS INVESTORS USE LIMIT ORDERS TO TRY TO MAKE SHORT TERM GAINS
ATTENDANTS IN SEARCH OF OTHER P. S. TWO CLONES HERE HAVE TO SCOUR CAREFULLY
ACER INTERNATIONAL CORP. OF TAIWAN SHOWS A MACHINE BILLED AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE LINE P. S. TWO MODEL THIRTY
THIS AVOIDS ALL THE LEGAL ISSUES AN ACER OFFICIAL PROMISES
BUT IT ALSO AVOIDS MOST OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE P. S. TWO FAMILY
MAURICE *LIPPENS* CHAIRMAN OF BELGIUM'S GROUPE A. G. WHO TEAMED UP WITH SUEZ FOR THE GENERALE DE *BELGIQUE* STRUGGLE CONCURS
THEY'RE RATHER ALLERGIC TO ALL THAT HE SAYS
THEY HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF ETHICS
BUT THEY SHOWED THAT BEHIND THE STAID FACADE THEIR MINDS WERE CLICKING
IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
BUT FRED MCINTYRE A RAILROAD WORKER IN OMAHA NEBRASKA VOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER INVEST IN THE MARKET AGAIN FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
WITH GOOD REASON
AS BLACK MONDAY DAWNED HE HELD IN HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT A HANDSOME NEST EGG OF MORE THAN FOUR TIMES HIS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR PAY
THE NEXT DAY ALL OF IT WAS GONE AND HE OWED HIS BROKER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO BOOT
DAVID MEISTER F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS A HALF A DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT THE OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MAXWELL
THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN <NOISE> CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANT BY INSTANT CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND
THE OFFICIAL SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN SIX MONTHS A- SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY BORROWED AND SOLD
STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY
EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND THE CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE FOURTHS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND ONE HALF TO TWENTY ONE
BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
SOURCES SAID AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE THIS MORNING IN TORONTO FOLLOWED BY A NEWS CONFERENCE
BURNS FRY'S ABOUT SEVENTY MEMBER BOARD YESTERDAY WAS PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL BY ITS ELEVEN MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ALREADY HAS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION
SECURITY PACIFIC'S BOARD APPROVED THE TRANSACTION AT A MEETING A FEW DAYS AGO THE SOURCES SAID
THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
OFF THE HOOK THE RESIGNATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CRIMINAL DIVISION CHIEF WELD ERASES RHODE ISLAND REPRESENTATIVE SAINT GERMAIN'S RISK OF INDICTMENT FOR TAKING MEALS FROM LOBBYISTS
AGENCY LAWYERS WHO RAN A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION URGED NO ACTION CITING HOUSE RULES ALLOWING NEARLY UNLIMITED ENTERTAINMENT
WELD WAS RELUCTANT TO DROP THE CASE
ROBERT RAVITZ A GREY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT SAYS THE AGENCY DID THE BEST IT COULD BASED ON DRAWINGS OF THE COIN
RESPONDING TO MISS JONES'S COMMENTS HE SAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS WITH THE ARTWORK
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME CRUNCH
IF WE HAD LONGER TIME I'M SURE WE COULD HAVE MASSAGED THE ARTWORK TO DEATH
SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
IT SEEMS THAT PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT ONCE AN UPSCALE PRODUCT PUTS ITS NAME ON LOWER PRICED GOODS IT CAN NEVER GO BACK UP
REVLON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING A LONG SHOT ATTEMPT TO REKINDLE THE HALSTON FLAME
REVLON OWNER OF HALSTON ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED HAS VISIONS OF SEEING HALSTON LABEL CLOTHES BACK IN BETTER DRESS DEPARTMENTS
BUT MARKETERS BELIEVE THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ITS SIX YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH RETAILER J. C. PENNEY COMPANY WHICH ENDED LAST YEAR
BUT WHEN L. B. O. COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM L. B. O.S ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
THEY'VE ADAPTED
THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORPORATION BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED HOW THE STATE SHOULD GET RID OF ITS HEFTY BUDGET SURPLUS NOW ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS
BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN REGISTERED DEMOCRATS SURVEYED BY THE FIELD INSTITUTE FAVORED GIVING THE MONEY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
BUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE THE MONEY TO BE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS
THAT APPEARS MORE IN LINE WITH REPUBLICAN THINKING
REPUBLICANS ASKED HOW TO DISBURSE THE SURPLUS SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PERSONAL TAX REBATES
HARRY TRUMAN WHISTLE STOPPED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAMPAIGNING AGAINST A PAROCHIAL DO NOTHING CONGRESS THAT WOULD NOT ENACT HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
HE STRUCK A CHORD IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET BUT ALSO DEFEATING SCORES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN THE PROCESS
TRUMAN RECOGNIZED THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS NOT JUST A RACE AMONG CANDIDATES BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE GREAT ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPER SEPARATION OF POWERS
THE CONTEST THEN ISN'T IDEOLOGICAL
IT'S CHARACTER PERSONALITY EXPERIENCE
IT'S CULTURAL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE
PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH UNDER THE AGREEMENT
IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS
THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN FIVE CANADIAN DOLLARS A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID
TRANSAMERICA SAID ITS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS ACHIEVED RECORD RESULTS IN THE QUARTER WITH CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE GROWING TO TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
ITS LEASING BUSINESS ALSO POSTED RECORD RESULTS
DEMAND FOR STANDARD CONTAINERS WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF STRONG WORLD TRADE TRANSAMERICA SAID
HOWEVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED COMPANY SAID ITS REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS REPORTED LOWER EARNINGS
THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
COULD BE
CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG BADLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAD BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN
NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD IDEA OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
INTERCO SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITS INTERCO SUBSIDIARY INCORPORATED UNIT TERMINATED ITS TENDER OFFER FOR ALL LANE COMMON SHARES AT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
THE OFFER WAS SET TO EXPIRE MONDAY
ANY SHARES TENDERED TO INTERCO UNDER THE OFFER WILL BE RETURNED TO LANE SHAREHOLDERS INTERCO SAID
NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
YEAH SAID MR. IACOCCA
MAYBE
MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. IACOCCA WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS
EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE SIGNED A NEW FOUR YEAR CONTRACT WITH CHRYSLER
AND IN TUESDAY'S INTERVIEW MR. IACOCCA MAINTAINED THAT HE WANTS TO LEAD THE COMPANY INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES
NEITHER THE VOLUNTEER DOCTORS NOR THE SCIENTISTS CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT KNEW WHICH VOLUNTEERS WERE TAKING ACTIVE ASPIRIN AND WHICH WERE TAKING PLACEBOS
HOWEVER A SEPARATE COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO MONITOR THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT AS IT PROCEEDED
IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE THAT IN DECEMBER DECIDED THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE ASPIRIN IN REDUCING HEART ATTACKS WERE SO CLEAR THERE WASN'T ANY NEED TO CONTINUE THE EXPERIMENT
IT'S A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE FACE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY OVERHANG SAYS MORGAN STANLEY'S MR. ROACH
A SLOWING OF GROWTH IN PRODUCTION GIVES COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO WORK OFF SOME INVENTORY
AND ECONOMISTS NOTE THAT THE STEADY OPERATING RATE INDICATES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
THE FOLLOWING DAY MR. LI MARCHED TO CITY HALL HIS AGING PASTRIES IN HAND AND DUMPED THEM ON THE DESK OF THE SURPRISED MAYOR
THE MARKETS ARE FULL OF POOR QUALITY PASTRIES MR. LI PROCLAIMED
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION

THE AVAILABLE SOVIET INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE ITS NORTH SEA NAVY ITS MOBILE ARMORED FORCES IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND ITS ARRAY OF CONVENTIONALLY ARMED TACTICAL MISSILES
WHETHER SUCH BLACKMAIL WOULD EVER BE SENSIBLE OR POSSIBLE IS ARGUABLE BUT OFFICIALS LIKE MR. ABSHIRE DON'T WANT MOSCOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE M- WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL *PERSPECTIVE* GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
HIS FIRST TEST ON THAT ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER HE CAN PERSUADE THE OPPOSITION TO FIELD A CANDIDATE AGAINST HIM
THE CHIEF OPPOSITION PARTY THE REUNIFICATION AND DEMOCRACY PARTY LED BY KIM YOUNG SAM HAS VOWED IT WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION
IT AND THE CO- NATIONAL COALITION FOR A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION A NEWLY FORMED ALLIANCE OF RELIGIOUS AND DISSIDENT GROUPS ARE ORGANIZING TOMORROW'S OPPOSITION RALLIES
NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
MR. REAGAN'S COMMENTS DON'T REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN HIS IP- INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION AGREEMENT
AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE THE PLAN SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD EITHER SIGN OR VETO THE SPECIFIC TAXES CONGRESS CHOOSES
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID BEFORE THAT IT ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROVISION ON TAKEOVERS
EVEN BEFORE MR. GARDINI'S BID FOR THE CHAIRMANSHIP MONTEDISON EXECUTIVES HAD SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER SELECTIVE DIVESTMENTS OF NON STRATEGIC COMPANIES
THE MOST OFTEN MENTIONED IS THE RETAIL CHAIN STANDA S. P. A.
STANDA HAS IMPRESSIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS BUT LACKLUSTER EARNINGS ON AN OPERATING LEVEL ACCORDING TO ONE FINANCIAL ANALYST
CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID
IT WAS THROUGH THESE CORRESPONDENT BANKS THAT MANUFACTURERS GOT ALL OF THESE ENERGY LOANS THAT HAVE SOURED
HOWEVER ONE MANUFACTURERS EXECUTIVE SAID HE DOUBTED CORRESPONDENT BANKING WOULD BE ELIMINATED IN LIGHT OF THAT BUSINESS'S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RECENTLY
GORDON PYE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT IRVING TRUST COMPANY CONTENDS THAT INTEREST RATES MAY DROP FURTHER BUT WILL LURCH BACK UP AGAIN LATER THIS YEAR
HE SAYS YIELDS ON LONG TERM TREASURY ISSUES MAY DECLINE TO AS LOW AS EIGHT PERCENT BUT THEN YIELDS WILL START MOVING THE OTHER WAY
WE'LL HIT TEN PERCENT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WE'LL GO PAST IT LATER THIS YEAR
WHILE MR. ARROYO WORKED IN PRESIDENT AQUINO'S OFFICE AND SAW HER EVERY DAY MR. ONGPIN WAS STILL HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD BARGAINING WITH THE BANKERS
TO CHEER ON HIS EXHAUSTED TEAM MEMBERS HE OUTFITTED THEM ONE DAY IN YELLOW NECKTIES THE COLOR OF THE AQUINO REVOLUTION
ON MARCH TWENTY SEVEN MR. ONGPIN REACHED A DEAL
THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW PORING OVER MR. SEOW'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS ASKING HOW HE'S BEEN PAYING HIS PHONE BILLS THESE PAST TEN YEARS
SIMILAR INQUIRIES LED TO THE EXPULSION FROM PARLIAMENT LAST DECEMBER OF JOSHUA B. JEYARETNAM LEAVING ONLY ONE OPPOSITION M. P.
A TEAM CANDIDATE PROPOSAL NOW UNDER STUDY WOULD ALSO SEEM LIKELY TO KEEP THE OPPOSITION FROM FINDING ITS WAY INTO GOVERNMENT OFFICE
BUT SINGAPORE'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION CITIZENS AREN'T LIKELY TO BENEFIT QUITE SO MUCH AS THE POLITICIANS OF MR. LEE'S RULING PARTY
INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
AND MR. BUSH PLEDGES TO MOVE FORWARD ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO HIM IN RECENT YEARS A PACT ELIMINATING CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
IT ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY BECAUSE OF VERIFICATION PROBLEMS MR. BUSH SAYS
BUT THAT REALLY IS A PASSION OF MINE
SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS AS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED

LAST WEEK HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS S:ETTLED ON THE HOUSE FINANCING PLAN
BUT WHEN THE HOUSE SENATE COMPROMISE WAS TAKEN UP ON THE HOUSE FLOOR YESTERDAY A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT BUSH WAS WAITING
IF THE CONFERENCE REPORT IS PRESENTED TO ME IN ITS CURRENT FORM HE WROTE I WILL VETO THE BILL
VOLKSWAGEN HAS MADE A SIMILAR MOVE IN THE U. S. WHERE IT UNVEILED ITS NEW CORRADO SPORTS COUPE LAST WEEK
IT IS OFFERING THE CAR WITH STANDARD FEATURES SUCH AS POWER WINDOWS AND AIR CONDITIONING THAT IT PREVIOUSLY SOLD AS OPTIONS
VOLKSWAGEN OFFICIALS IN THE U. S. HAD FOUGHT TO PERSUADE THE WEST GERMAN COMPANY TO STOP SHIPPING STARKLY FURNISHED CARS THAT MUST COMPETE WITH WELL EQUIPPED JAPANESE VEHICLES

INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY RANGING FROM INCREASES OF ONE PERCENT TO FIVE PERCENT
RICHARD STEIN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FINANCE O(F)- AT WORLDS OF WONDER SAID THE STOCK PROBABLY WAS MOVING DOWN IN SYMPATHY WITH OTHER TOY COMPANIES
HOWEVER HE SAID WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW TOY COMPANIES THAT EXPECT AN UP FOURTH QUARTER
HE SAID THE COMPANY IS EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS IN SALES OF TEDDY RUXPIN ITS TALKING TEDDY BEAR AND OF LASER TAG AN INFRARED GUN GAME
TO HELP BOOST SALES FORD HAS SENT OUT LETTERS TO DEALERS TOUTING THE AIR BAG
ITS SAFETY DIRECTOR ALSO SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS VISITING DEALERS AND PROMOTING THE DEVICE
THE FORD SPOKESMAN SAID THIS LATEST INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE CUSTOMERS' PERCEIVED VALUE OF THE AIR BAGS
THE CONCESSIONS WERE DISCLOSED BY TOYOO GYOHTEN VICE MINISTER OF THE JAPANESE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AFTER TALKS YESTERDAY WITH U. S. ASSISTANT TREASURY SECRETARY DAVID MULFORD
MR. MULFORD WELCOMED THESE AND OTHER RECENT JAPANESE FINANCIAL I- INITIATIVES
BUT HE SAID SUBSTANTIAL FURTHER PROGRESS IS NEEDED IN THE LIBERALIZATION AND DEREGULATION OF JAPAN'S DOMESTIC FINANCIAL MARKETS
A LOS ANGELES BANKRUPTCY COURT MONDAY APPROVED ARGO'S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS INTEREST IN ARGO'S OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SENECA SAID IT WILL REFINANCE SOME OF THE ARGO DEBT
IN ADDITION SENECA SAID IT AND THE SUCCESSOR CORPORATION TO ARGO WILL ENTER INTO A JOINT VENTURE TO EXPLORE AND FURTHER DEVELOP THE ARGO PROPERTIES IT IS ACQUIRING
BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND
THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT
IN CONTRAST IF THE UTILITY BEGAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THEY THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW HE SAID
IN EITHER CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE UTILITY'S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED HE SAID
WITH EUROPE HAVING MADE CONCESSIONS TO THE U. S. MR. BAKER AND FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN *ALAN* GREENSPAN COULD COME UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE TO HELP STEM THE DOLLAR'S RECENT FALL
FOR WEEKS THE U. S. CURRENCY HAS BEEN PLUMMETING
RATHER THAN RAISE INTEREST RATES TO SUPPORT THE CURRENCY THE FED HAS FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING AMPLE LIQUIDITY TO FEND OFF A RECESSION FOLLOWING THE STOCK MARKET CRASH
SOME REPORTERS WERE MORE ORIGINAL
A PAIR FROM A LOCAL PAPER ASKED EDSEL IF HE FAVORED CASINO GAMBLING IN DETROIT A CONCEPT HEAVILY PROMOTED BY MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG
THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD
I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I WANT TO GET THEM OUT OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST
LAST YEAR SEVERAL MAJOR CITIES INCLUDING JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA AND CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA PROHIBITED OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED CONSTRUCTION OF NEW OUTDOOR ADVERTISEMENTS
JUST LAST MONTH SAINT LOUIS ADOPTED A BILLBOARD BAN
AND OFFICIALS IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA AND DENVER ARE CONSIDERING CRACKING DOWN
NINETEEN NINETY NINE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A SERVING PRESIDENT
IT IS ALL A PRESIDENT CAN DO TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS TIME FOR REFLECTION IS A LUXURY BEYOND REACH
NOR IS THERE TIME FOR A PRESIDENT TO LEARN MUCH BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE WITH WHICH HE COMES TO OFFICE
THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN WE THINK NOT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
FRESH FACES APPEAR AT THE RAINBOW KITCHEN ALMOST DAILY AMONG THEM A YOUNG COUPLE BACK FROM A DISILLUSIONING JOB HUNTING SOJOURN TO THE SUN BELT
THEY EXPECT TO BE ON THEIR FEET IN A MONTH
OTHERS SHOW UP BETWEEN ODD JOBS OR IN THE SUMMER WHEN THEIR CHILDREN CAN'T GET FREE LUNCH AT SCHOOL
MR. DUKAKIS IS IN FACT A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN
HIS FATHER PANOS ARRIVED IN NEW YORK <*IN*> IN NINETEEN TWELVE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
HIS MOTHER ARRIVED A YEAR LATER WHEN SHE WAS NINE
GOVERNOR DUKAKIS'S AIDES MAINTAIN AN *ADMIRABLE* PUBLIC OPTIMISM BUT IN PRIVATE MOMENTS ONE CAN DETECT A CREEPING DISMAY
TO A PERSON THEY A- ATTRIBUTE THEIR SLIDE IN THE POLLS NOT TO ANY FAILURE IN THEIR MESSAGE BUT TO MR. BUSH'S LIES AND NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN
<NOISE> ALL OF OUR STUFF SHOWS SAYS FIELD DIRECTOR CHARLIE BAKER THAT IF WE GET OUR MESSAGE OUT WE WIN
MAYTAG IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY APPLIANCE COMPANY IN THE U. S. SAID CHARLES RYAN AN ANALYST WITH MERRILL LYNCH RESEARCH
HOOVER IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY COMPANY OUTSIDE THE U. S.
IT'S A GOOD FIT
PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS
OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION S- SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN *NONRESIDENTIAL* CONSTRUCTION
I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUIN:ING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
LAST YEAR WAS THE WORST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IN THE RAW NUMBER OF DOWNGRADES AND THE SECOND WORST ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS
SOME SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL CHANGES IN DEBT RATINGS WERE NEGATIVE LAST YEAR COMPARED WITH SEVENTY THREE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
THE BEST YEAR OF THE PAST SIX WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN WHICH FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF REPORTED CHANGES WERE DOWNGRADES
THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO *ATTRACT* INVESTORS-
J. P.
MORGAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HERO OF MINE MR. FARKAS SAYS
OF COURSE HE QUICKLY ADDS I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A ROBBER BARON IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM
A MAN WHO DOES THIS THE CONGRESSMEN PROFESS TO BELIEVE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
CERTAINLY HE CAN'T ASSOCIATE WITH THE BOY SCOUTS WHO INHABIT CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOMS
OFF WITH HIS HEAD
MR. PETERS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD WAS FIRED LAST JANUARY IN A MANAGEMENT DISPUTE AFTER THIRTY YEARS WITH J. W. T.
HE PLANNED TO START A COMPANY TO IMPORT HANDMADE GOODS FROM EUROPE
HE ALSO LOOKED FORWARD TO EXPANDING THE TINY CHARTER AIRCRAFT CONCERN THAT HAD BEEN HIS HOBBY FOR YEARS
THEN LAST FEBRUARY HE WAS CONTACTED BY MARTIN SORRELL CHAIRMAN OF W. P. P. THE BRITISH MARKETING SERVICES CONCERN
WHAT REMAINS FOR HISTORY TO JUDGE IS FIRST HOW WELL HE SUCCEEDED
HERE THE JUDGMENT MAY BE MIXED
WE DO HAVE LESS TAXES AND LESS INFLATION BUT BIGGER SPENDING AND AS MUCH GOVERNMENT AS BEFORE
HISTORY'S SECOND JUDGMENT WILL BE WHETHER HIS YEARS REPRESENT A MERE PASSING CHANGE OR WHETHER THE CHANGE WILL ENDURE
WE CANNOT SAY TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT COMES HEREAFTER AND WHAT COMES HEREAFTER WILL DECIDE MR. REAGAN'S PLACE AMONG OUR PRESIDENTS
WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
AND SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW WAITING
SIGNS OF CHANGE ARE EVERYWHERE
ALTHOUGH FEW FIRMS ADMIT TO *STAFF* CUTS MANY ARE QUIETLY PRUNING THEIR RANKS
MANY HAVE SHIFTED THEIR SPECIALISTS IN TAX EXEMPT HOUSING BONDS WHERE ACTIVITY IS PARTICULARLY LOW TO THEIR MORTGAGE BACKED BOND OPERATIONS
UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BLACK AND DECKER HAS COUNTERED AMERICAN STANDARD'S RIGHTS PLAN BY SEEKING SHAREHOLDERS' CONSENT TO TAKE CONTROL OF AMERICAN STANDARD'S BOARD
THE MANEUVER IS SIMILAR TO A PROXY FIGHT BUT DOESN'T REQUIRE A SHAREHOLDER MEETING
BLACK AND DECKER IS AWAITING SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CLEARANCE TO BEGIN THE CONSENT SOLIC:ITATION
NO HE'S NOT
TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCT HE SAYS HIS VOICE RISING AND HIS PARTY MANNERS WEARING THIN
THEY OUGHT TO BE ACCORDED THE SAME FAIRNESS AS PEOPLE WHO SELL HOUSE PLANTS
BUT THIS RELIANCE ALSO RAISES THE STAKES IN THE FARMERS RACE
THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL BURKE AN ANALYST AT LONDON STOCKBROKERS KLEINWORT GRIEVESON SECURITIES
AND YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS A LOSER WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN AMERICA
ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY
HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES
WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
BEVERLY HAS A HISTORY OF CONTENTIOUS RELATIONS WITH UNIONS
BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BEVERLY'S MANAGEMENT WAS THE TARGET OF SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL PROXY FIGHTS WAGED BY THE A. F. L. C. I. O.
<NOISE> NONE OF THE UNION PROPOSALS HOWEVER RECEIVED VOTES FROM MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF SHAREHOLDERS
HEADING THE LIST IS HONGKONG BANK WHICH IS BUYING OUT THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF MARINE MIDLAND BANK ITS PRINCIPAL U. S. SUBSIDIARY FOR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
JOHN GRAY A HONGKONG BANK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CONFIRMED THAT THE BANK IS SHOPPING FOR A EUROPEAN ACQUISITION BUT MAINTAINS THAT NO SPECIFIC TARGET IS IN SIGHT YET
EUROPE IS WHERE THE GAP IS IN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS HE SAID
EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND THE CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
CLEARLY SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN EUROPE
IT ISN'T THAT THE WALL IS ABOUT TO FALL ANY TIME SOON
BUT THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH SERIOUS EUROPEANS DISCUSS THE PROSPECT VIVIDLY UNDERSCORES THE IMPACT ON WESTERN EUROPE OF MR. GORBACHEV AND HIS REFORM POLICIES
YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED NEW YORK
YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ELECTION HE PUT INTO EFFECT THE SOCIALIST PROGRAM OF FAST REFLATION AND WHOLESALE NATIONALIZATION
AS INFLATION SOARED AND THE FRANC NOSE DIVED HIS APPROVAL RATING PLUNGED
THEN HE CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY
HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AUSTERITY PROGRAM WAS APPLAUDED BY EVEN HIS RIGHT WING OPPONENTS
AFTER NAMING FOUR COMMUNISTS TO HIS ORIGINAL CABINET HE BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND DESTROYED THEM AS A POLITICAL FORCE
THE TOKYO FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET IS CLOSED ON SATURDAYS
EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS WERE CLOSED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EXCEPT MILAN WHERE PRICES EDGED UP IN FRIDAY'S SESSION
THE MILAN STOCK INDEX CLOSED UP SEVEN LIRE AT <NOISE> ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX
WHO'S RIGHT
IN SOME RESPECTS THEY ALL ARE BUT THE BLAME DOESN'T REST ON OSHA'S SHOULDERS ALONE
THE AGENCY HAS COME UNDER FIRE FOR DOING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE FROM THE DAY ITS DOORS OPENED ON CONSTITUTION AVENUE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO
THE REALITY IS THAT OSHA'S EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN PINCHED BY BUDGET AND STAFF CUTS AND ITS GRASP ON BUSINESS LOOSENED BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S DEREGULATORY SHOCK TROOPS
SOUTH AFRICA ANGOLA AND CUBA ENDED A ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT OR A DATE TO MEET AGAIN
BUT SOURCES SAID THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH INVOLVE NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PEACE IN ANGOLA HAVE MADE PROGRESS
APPARENTLY THE THREE NATIONS ARE FOCUSING ON A U. S. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD GET CUBAN TROOPS OUT OF ANGOLA IN TWO YEARS
MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
COMPANIES LISTED BELOW REPORTED QUARTERLY PROFIT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE AVERAGE OF ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES
THE COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST THREE ANALYSTS AND HAD A MINIMUM FIVE CENT CHANGE IN ACTUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE
ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL RESULTS INVOLVING LOSSES ARE OMITTED
PAYOFFS TO MOSCOW BY THE WEST COULD RANGE FROM SOFTENING HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES TO EXTENDING CHEAP LOANS TO RELAXING TECHNOLOGY CONTROLS
THE AVAILABLE SOVIET INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE ITS NORTH SEA NAVY ITS MOBILE ARMORED FORCES IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND ITS ARRAY OF CONVENTIONALLY ARMED TACTICAL MISSILES
WHETHER SUCH BLACKMAIL WOULD EVER BE SENSIBLE OR POSSIBLE IS ARGUABLE BUT OFFICIALS LIKE MR. ABSHIRE DON'T WANT MOSCOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY
DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
FUJITSU LIMITED'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF FIVE YEAR EUROBONDS WITH THE SAME BASIC TERMS CLOSED AT NINETY EIGHT TO NINETY NINE
THE JAPANESE ELECTRONICS CONCERN IS AFFECTED BY THE U. S.'S NEWLY IMPOSED DUTIES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL AT NIKKO SECURITIES COMPANY WHICH LED THE ISSUE
BUT IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW LARGE THE IMPACT WILL BE
MOST OF THE LOAN WOULD BE USED TO REIMBURSE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPORTERS FOR GOODS THEY WOULD IMPORT AND THEN INCORPORATE INTO PRODUCTS THAT COULD BE EXPORTED
THE LOAN WOULD BE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS INCLUDING THREE YEARS OF GRACE AND CARRY A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE TIED TO THE BANK'S BORROWING COSTS
THE RATE CURRENTLY STANDS AT SEVEN POINT NINE TWO PERCENT
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE TO TELL MY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HARM YOU'RE DOING TO YOURSELF BY MAKING PRODUCTS OF INSUFFICIENT QUALITY
MR. LEVY SAYS
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH
THEN A YOUNG MAN APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY
NO DELIVERY TODAY HE SAYS
I TALKED TO THE MANAGER
THE WOMEN SHRUG AND GO HOME
ANOTHER BAROMETER OF THE ECONOMY'S FUTURE COURSE CALLED THE LONG LEADING COMPOSITE IS COMPILED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CYCLE RESEARCH
THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE HAS SIGNALED RECESSIONS ON THE AVERAGE BY FOURTEEN MONTHS <NOISE> A SOMEWHAT LONGER LEAD TIME THAN FOR THE COMMERCE INDEX
IT IS NO SURPRISE ACCORDINGLY THAT THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE REACHED A PEAK BEFORE THE COMMERCE INDEX IN JULY
SINCE THEN THE COMPOSITE HAS FALLEN WITH LITTLE INTERRUPTION
HOWEVER NET LOSSES IN EURODOLLAR BOND PRICES WERE ESTIMATED AT ONLY ONE EIGHTH TO THREE EIGHTHS POINT BY TRADERS
THE BENCHMARK CANADIAN NINE PERCENT BONDS DUE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WERE BID THIRTY BASIS POINTS LOWER
THE EURODOLLAR BOND MARKET STILL HAS A LOT OF UNDERLYING STRENGTH SAID A SENIOR TRADER FOR ONE EUROPEAN BANK
FINE ANSWERED HIS FRIEND JOHN REILLY
WHO CAN YOU TELL
CERTAINLY NOT THE PUBLIC MR. REILLY NOW SAYS WITH A CHUCKLE
GOD YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW
C. P. I. IS A CLOSELY OWNED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST WITH ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS
ITS SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PENSION FUNDS
C. P. I. ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE LITIGATION BUT SOME OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LOVE TO SLOW DOWN THE ACTIVITY IN LEVERAGED TAKEOVERS
THE U. S. BOND MARKET MEANWHILE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH TWO PERSISTENT PROBLEMS
THE U. S. TRADE DEFICIT CREATES PRESSURE FOR A LOWER DOLLAR
THE THREAT OF RISING INFLATION BECOMES GREATER AS THE DOLLAR WEAKENS AND AS CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LATE STAGE OF AN ECONOMIC BOOM PUSH UP WAGES AND PRICES
BUT SOME ARGUE AGENDA COULD BE A BIG HIT AND CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF SOFTWARE
THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY NEW AND DIFFERENT
IT'S TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING SAYS ESTHER DYSON EDITOR OF RELEASE ONE POINT OH A NEWSLETTER THAT COVERS COMPUTER SOFTWARE
I THINK IT'S AN EXTREMELY USEFUL TOOL SAYS MORT ROSENTHAL CHAIRMAN OF CORPORATE SOFTWARE INCORPORATED A WESTWOOD MASSACHUSETTS BASED SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTOR
HE SAYS HE USES AGENDA MORE THAN ANY OTHER SOFTWARE
ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
A SIMPLER WAY TO REDUCE BANK DEBTS THAT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO BORROWERS ARE STRAIGHT BUY BACKS IN THE GROWING SECONDARY LOAN MARKET
BUY BACKS HELPED CLEAR UP LATIN AMERICAN DEBT PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES
IN MARCH BOLIVIA BOUGHT BACK JUST UNDER HALF ITS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR BANK DEBT AT ELEVEN CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF DEBT
NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
CLARK SAID FRIDAY IT WAS INFORMED BY BARRIS THAT IT OWNED ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF CLARK'S STOCK AND INTENDED TO ACQUIRE A LARGER STAKE
GIANT ALSO SAID LAST WEEK THAT IT HELD CLARK SHARES BUT IT DIDN'T DISCLOSE HOW MANY
GIANT AND CLARK SAID THEY EACH MAY EVENTUALLY ACQUIRE FIFTEEN PERCENT OR MORE OF CLARK'S SHARES
WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT WORKED
IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
THE OPPOSITION IS ALREADY ROLLING
MANY OF THE PRESSURE GROUPS THAT CAMPAIGNED UNSUCCESSFULLY AGAINST MR. REAGAN IN TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS SEEM TO REGARD THIS BATTLE AS THEIR ARMAGEDDON
TEDDY KENNEDY HIMSELF HAS TESTIFIED THAT JUDGE BORK'S APPEARANCE MEANS THE END IS NEAR
IF RONALD REAGAN WANTS ROBERT BORK CONFIRMED HE WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE CHOICE TO THE ONE <NOISE> THESE GROUPS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON UNDECIDED SENATORS
THAT MEANS MR. REAGAN HAS TO EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHY AMERICAN SOCIETY WILL BENEFIT IF JUDGES SUCH AS ROBERT BORK APPLY THE LAW IN A NEUTRAL MANNER
HE WILL HAVE TO POINT OUT WHY MANY OF THE LONG HELD GRIEVANCES OF THE ELECTORATE RESULT WHEN UN- WHEN UNELECTED JUDGES MANUFACTURE NEW LAWS
CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SOME DEMOCRATS ARE WARMING TO THE IDEA
PRIVATIZATION OFTEN IS SIMPLY GOOD MANAGEMENT SENSE
IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS JUST AN IDEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT SAYS DAVID LINOWES A DEMOCRAT WHO CHAIRS PRESIDENT REAGAN'S COMMISSION ON PRIVATIZATION <NOISE> WHICH ISSUES ITS REPORT NEXT MONTH
ADDS DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS ECKART OF OHIO WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES AND BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE SERVICES
THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN DROP DEAD BUT I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE
SOME DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT MAY GET SOME OF HIS PRIVATIZATION INITIATIVES ENACTED BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE
ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO REMAIN POOR BECAUSE YOU WANT TO STUDY TROPICAL ANIMALS
IS YOUR STUDY MORE IMPORTANT THAN FILLING THE EMPTY STOMACHS OF POOR PEOPLE
ARE MALAYSIANS EXPECTED TO LOSE MILLIONS OF POUNDS SO THAT YOU CAN STUDY ANIMALS
A LORIMAR SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT MR. ADELSON AGREED TO BUY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND SHARES <NOISE> OF LORIMAR STOCK FROM MR. GARIN
THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN MESSRS.
ADELSON AND GARIN WAS ARRANGED BEFORE DISCUSSIONS RESUMED WITH WARNER
THE G. O. P. SEEMS PRIMED IN OTHER WORDS FOR A REPLAY OF OLD VALUES THEMES
BUT A PARADOX ARISES
MR. BUSH NEVER WAS STRONGLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE WING OF THE PARTY
MR. REAGAN HIMSELF WHEN HE GOT I- IN OFFICE PUT ITS ISSUES ON THE BACK BURNER
CONISTON AMONG OTHER THINGS IS CALLING FOR A NEW VOTE
IT ALSO ASKS FOR FINANCIAL COMPENSATION TO COVER COURT EXPENSES AND COSTS INCURRED DURING THE PROXY SOLICITATION
A TRIAL ON THE SUIT HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONDAY
MR.
WOODS A LEADER IN THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY FOR THIRTY YEARS SET THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STATION AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE
HE PAID WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH
THE COURT CANNOT UNDO HIS BAD BARGAIN THE COURT RULED
UNITED ALSO DISPUTED CONTINEN:TAL'S ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD OFFER LOWER FARES
A SPOKESMAN SAID UNITED HAS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO REDUCE FARES TO JAPAN BUT HAS BEEN OPPOSED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH FEARED INCREASED COMPETITION FOR ITS NATIONAL CARRIERS
FARES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE CHANGED ONLY THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENT
THE BOND ISSUANCE PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL
AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEARED STALLED ANALYSTS SAID
IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR
THE DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE OPERATOR SAID THE CHARGE WILL REFLECT A WRITE DOWN OF FIXED ASSETS <NOISE> INVENTORY DISPOSAL AND SEVERANCE PAY IN RELATION TO THE STORE CLOSING

IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
HE HAD A POINT
VITALY YURCHENKO OF THE K. G. B. THE MAN WHO HAD W- TOLD THE F. B. I. OF A SPY CODE NAMED MR.

AND MR. PELTON HADN'T STOLEN ANY NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY DOCUMENTS TO GIVE THE SOVIETS
<NOISE> MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS ON THE BIG BOARD COMPARED WITH A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION TUESDAY
DESPITE THE NEW HIGHS IN THE CLOSELY WATCHED MARKET BAROMETERS THE ADVANCING ISSUES NEVER HAD AN IMPRESSIVE LEAD OVER DECLINERS DURING THE SESSION
BY THE CLOSE THE TALLY STOOD AT EIGHT HUNDRED TEN GAINERS AND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN DECLINERS
ELSINORE CORPORATION'S ATLANTIS OPERATING UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY CODE REPORTED THE LARGEST DROP IN WINNINGS
ATLANTIS WINNINGS FELL TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN THE CASINO IS PROTECTED FROM CREDITORS WHILE IT WORKS OUT A PLAN TO PAY DEBT
NEARLY ALL THE GAINERS WERE COMPANIES THAT SELL TO CUSTOMERS OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS
INTEL THE BIGGEST O. T. C. SEMICONDUCTOR MAKER AND BY FAR THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS ISSUE ON NASDAQ FELL ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY THREE AND THREE QUARTERS
L. S. I. LOGIC ANOTHER BIG SEMICONDUCTOR CONCERN WITH SOME P. C. MAKING CUSTOMERS WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS

STEVEN EINHORN CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST FOR GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY URGES A MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH
HE HAS BEEN ARGUING FOR MONTHS THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS TRAPPED IN AN ECONOMIC BOX THAT WILL LIMIT ANY RALLIES
FOR ONE THING HE ISN'T YET CONVINCED THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING
AND IF IT REALLY IS HE SAYS INVESTORS SHOULD THINK THROUGH THE IMPLICATIONS
MOREOVER MR. FAIR'S PREDICTIONS TEND TO IMPROVE WITH AGE
BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX HE WAS GIVING PRESIDENT FORD THE INCUMBENT'S FOUR POINT ADVANTAGE
AFTER THE ELECTION HE TOOK IT AWAY
UNLIKE LYNDON JOHNSON MR. FORD WASN'T EVER ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT MR. FAIR EXPLAINS FEEBLY

CONTRA LEADERS SAY THEY LOOK FORWARD TO THE MILITARY CHALLENGE
IT'S IN OUR BALLPARK SAYS CARLOS ULVERT THE CONTRA FOREIGN SECRETARY
HE AND OTHER CONTRAS ASSERT THAT CONGRESSIONAL STINGINESS UNTIL THIS YEAR KEPT THE *CONTRAS* FROM PICKING UP STEAM ON THE BATTLEFIELD
MR. *ULVERT* ADDS IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TEN THOUSAND MEN IN NICARAGUA BETTER TRAINED AND BETTER SUPPLIED THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE IS GOING TO BE FELT
FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
<NOISE> MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
NOW TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOXES DATING BACK TO NINETEEN OH NINE ARE ON DISPLAY BENEATH TRACK LIGHTING IN A SPECIAL ROOM IN HIS HOUSE
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY OTHER BOXES ARE IN THE GARAGE
THEY ARE OF A MORE RECENT VINTAGE AND MR. COOK IS WAITING FOR THEM TO APPRECIATE IN VALUE

THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
NATO LEADERS ENDED A TWO DAY SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS
THE ALLIANCE ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE THAT STRESSED ITS DETERMINATION TO DECIDE ON A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO FURTHER ARMS CONTROL TREATIES
BUT IT SIDESTEPPED DECISIONS ON DIVISIVE ISSUES SUCH AS MODERNIZING THE SHORT RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BASED IN WEST GERMANY
THAT GROWTH CAME IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF WHICH PROMPTED A FLOOD OF MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS
IT ALSO REFLECTED GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO <NOISE> STIMULATE DOMESTIC SPENDING
THE HOUSING BOOM IN TURN TRIGGERED HEAVY CONSUMER SPENDING ON HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH AIDED THE STRONG SECOND HALF ECONOMIC EXPANSION
INFLATION ADJUSTED GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT GREW TWO PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM FROM THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS AND ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
MR. BREGMAN SAID IN AN INTERVIEW THAT MR. GILLET TE- TELEPHONED HIM FRIDAY WITH THIRTY TWO DOLLARS A SHARE OFFER FOR THE PARTNERSHIP'S STOCK

OTHERS WILL REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO THEM
WHAT MANY ARE BUYING INSTEAD BONDS ISSUED BY UTILITIES BANKS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES THOSE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF BEING BOUGHT OUT
OTHERS ARE BUYING SAFER TREASURY BONDS WHOSE YIELDS ARE A PERCENTAGE OR LESS BELOW TOP GRADE INDUSTRIAL DEBT
AND WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WAVING THE COMPETITIVENESS FLAG WON'T THE ARGUMENT GET A LITTLE SHOPWORN
SAYS MR. KAY IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT IMPROVING U. S. COMPETITIVENESS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS HAS TO BE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THERE MAY BE SOME WEAKER MEMBERS AMONG US BUT OPEC AS A WHOLE ISN'T OVERPRODUCING
<NOISE> THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE
<NOISE> PUBLISHING SO CALLED BACKLIST BOOKS THAT ARE KEPT IN PRINT FOR YEARS ON END HAS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER PUBLISHING BEST SELLERS
A GOOD FISHING BOOK WILL NEVER MATCH A JACKIE COLLINS NOVEL IN TOTAL SALES
BUT IT WILL OUTLIVE HER RACY FICTION WITH ITS FICKLE READERS
PUBLISHERS WILL DUMP MOST OF THIS YEAR'S BEST SELLERS ON REMAINDER TABLES NEXT YEAR WHERE THEY MAY FETCH AS LITTLE AS A DOLLAR APIECE
CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
REPRESENTATIVE BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN

I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW WELL THE SCENTS HAVE DONE ON THE MARKET SAID THOMAS CONLEY EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FISHING TACKLE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
BUT THEN AGAIN ANY TIME YOU GET A PRODUCT THAT CALLS ATTENTION TO FISHING IT'S GOOD AS A WHOLE
SOME CALL WHATEVER IT IS A GIMMICK WHILE OTHERS SAY IT'S THE BEST THING SINCE THE ROD AND REEL
EITHER WAY IT GETS PEOPLE TO TRY IT
MOREOVER MR. SAWYER ISN'T THOUGHT TO POSSESS A LOT OF CLOUT
HE DOESN'T FIT THE BOSS IMAGE THAT THE LATE MAYOR DALEY MADE FAMOUS AND THAT MAYOR WASHINGTON WAS BEGINNING TO ACQUIRE
HE'S A WEAK GUY SAYS MR. ROSE THE POLITICAL CONSULTANT SUBJECT TO A LOT OF PRESSURE AND OBVIOUSLY NOT A CRUSADER
THE COMPANY SAID IT INTENDS TO PURCHASE THOSE SHARES TENDERED AT OR BELOW TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
SHARES TENDERED AT HIGHER PRICES WILL BE RETURNED TO HOLDERS TORCHMARK SAID
IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING FRIDAY TORCHMARK CLOSED AT TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE UP A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE

THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCES CRY OUT FOR A STRONG PRESIDENT TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM AND TO PERSUADE A CHAOTIC CONGRESS TO ACCEPT HIS PROGRAM
ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE ARE KNOTTY PROBLEMS FOR THE U. S. FROM LATIN AMERICA NICARAGUA AND PANAMA TO THE MIDDLE EAST
OUR PRESIDENCY IS NOT JUST A CEREMONIAL OFFICE ITS DEMANDS ARE SUCH AS TO TRY ANY MAN'S SPIRIT INTELLIGENCE AND POLITICAL SKILL
NEITHER COMPANY HAS DISCLOSED A POSSIBLE PRICE BUT THE PRESENCE OF TWO INTERESTED PARTIES IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT ANY BUYER WOULD HAVE TO PAY
WELL THE COMPANY P. S. OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IS IN PLAY SAID DANIEL SCOTTO AN ANALYST AT L. F. ROTHSCHILD
THE MORE PEOPLE INTERESTED THE HIGHER THE PRICE YOU'LL FETCH
NEW YORK PUBLICISTS ACTUALLY ARE UPSET
FOR THEM AND THEIR CELEBRITY CLIENTS GETTING INTO SUZY'S COLUMN RATIFIES THEIR IMPORTANCE

BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT DAY ISN'T WORRIED
WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAYS
WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME

THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
RICK BRIGGS PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID FALCONBRIDGE'S LATEST PROPOSALS ON CONTRACTING OUT ARE NOT ENCOURAGING
THE PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED YESTERDAY AFTER A TWO DAY RECESS IN THE TALKS
ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF FALCONBRIDGE'S NICKEL OUTPUT COMES FROM ITS SUDBURY OPERATIONS
HOW DID THE BOARD VOTE ON THE REDUCTION PLAN
IT DIDN'T SAYS MR. MILLER
A TWENTY TWO MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NOW SLASHED TO SEVEN BECAUSE OF RESIGNATIONS HANDLED THE VOTING
THE PLAN PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
TERMS WEREN'T DISCLOSED
THE CONSTRUCTION HAS ALREADY BEGUN AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL
<NOISE> HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG <NOISE>
THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
MR. KAGLER WOULD BURST OUT OF THE OFFICE COMMENTING SARCASTICALLY TO SECRETARIES ABOUT COLLEAGUES HE CONSIDERED SLOW MOVING INCLUDING MR. EVERINGHAM
<NOISE> AT FIRST WHAT HE DID WAS STRATEGIC TO PROD EVERINGHAM SAYS ONE OFFICIAL FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION
LATER IT WAS FROM SHEER FRUSTRATION
BUT THE CORPSE WAS SOON WALKING
DURING THE PROGRESSIVE ERA PRESSURE FOR MORE FEDERAL SPENDING DEVELOPED
IN NINETEEN OH EIGHT THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM BACKED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW CONGRESS TO IMPOSE A NEW TAX DIRECTLY ON INCOME
IN JULY NINETEEN OH NINE CONGRESS SENT SUCH AN AMENDMENT TO THE STATES FOR RATIFICATION
U. S. AIR OPERATES PRIMARILY IN THE EAST AND MIDWEST
P. S. A. SERVES TWENTY NINE AIRPORTS MAINLY ON THE WEST COAST
THE COMBINATION WOULD CREATE THE SEVENTH LARGEST DOMESTIC AIR CARRIER
THE GOAL OF RESURGENT CONSERVATIVES HAVE BEEN THE SAME ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC A RETURN TO A FREE MARKET ECONOMY AND A STRONG DEFENSE
MRS. THATCHER'S REFORMS HAVE LACKED SOME SUPPLY SIDE ELEMENTS WE FEEL WOULD HAVE IMPROVED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS
SHE HASN'T MADE A SIGNIFICANT MOVE ON TOP MARGINAL RATES SINCE HER FIRST TERM
INSTEAD SHE HAS FOCUSED ON THE LESS INCENTIVE SENSITIVE BASIC RATE EDGING IT DOWNWARD POINT BY POINT
NATO LEADERS ENDED A TWO DAY SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS
THE ALLIANCE ISSUED TO A COMMUNIQUE THAT STRESSED ITS DETERMINATION TO DECIDE ON A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO FURTHER ARMS CONTROL TREATIES
BUT IT SIDESTEPPED DECISIONS ON DIVERSE ISSUES SUCH AS MODERNIZING THE SHORT RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BASED IN WEST GERMANY
BY CONTRACTING OUT PRODUCTION TO AMERICAN PLANTS THEY ARE SAVING MORE THAN A DIME PER CAN OF DRINK
THEIR NEXT LOGICAL STEP ANALYSTS SAY WILL BE TO ACQUIRE U. S. SOFT DRINK CONCERNS
<NOISE> EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT BREAK INTO THE ENORMOUS U. S. MARKET
IN GENERAL JACKSON STRATEGISTS SAID THAT THEY ARE PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE DUKAKIS CAMPAIGN IS TREATING THEM
ADVISER ANN LEWIS PRAISED THE ATMOSPHERE OF RESPECT AND FAIR PLAY THAT SURROUNDED BOTH THE PLATFORM AND THE RULES DISCUSSIONS
WE KNEW THE MATH MR. LEWIS SAID
WE WANTED THE FAIREST THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO STATE OUR CASE
WE'VE HAD THAT
STEW LEONARD WHO RUNS STEW LEONARD'S A LARGE GROCERY STORE IN NORWALK CONNECTICUT *ACCOMMODATED* ALL FOUR OF HIS CHILDREN THIS WAY
HE FIRST NAMED HIS OLDEST SON PRESIDENT
THEN HE SET UP A BAKERY BUSINESS IN THE STORE FOR HIS DAUGHTER
FOR HIS YOUNGER SON HE CREATED AN OPEN AIR FARMER'S MARKET IN DANBURY CONNECTICUT WHERE HE ALSO IS BUILDING A SUPERMARKET FOR THE SON TO RUN
AND MR. LEONARD'S OTHER DAUGHTER
SHE HAS BECOME DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY'S HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT
BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN A PLANT
YEAH WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
THE BELLEVUE WASHINGTON TRUCK MAKER SAID TRUCK SALES IN CANADA AUSTRALIA THE UNITED KINGDOM AND MEXICO ALL SHOWED GAINS
SALES OF MINING EQUIPMENT ALSO PICKED UP ALTHOUGH OIL FIELD SERVICE EQUIPMENT SALES CONTINUED TO SLUMP
THE COMPANY ALSO CITED A LOWER INCOME TAX RATE
THE INESCAPABLE FACT HOWEVER IS THAT ONE DAY THE WATER IS GOING TO RUN OUT OR BECOME TOO *EXPENSIVE* TO PUMP UP
WE'RE GOING TO SEE LESS PRODUCTION
<NOISE> THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT SAYS KANSAS STATE EXTENSION ECONOMIST MARK NELSON
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A CATACLYSMIC THING
THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
THAT MAKES A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO *PUGET* SOUND SHIPYARDS
THE DISCLOSURES CAME IN A PROXY STATEMENT AMENDMENT FILED YESTERDAY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY *SHAREHOLDERS* OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS FALLOFF HERE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER DOLDRUMS ONE TRADER SAYS
HE ESTIMATES THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOLUME HAS TUMBLED FROM YEAR EARLIER LEVELS BY FORTY PERCENT SO FAR THIS MONTH AND THIRTY PERCENT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE
LET'S FACE IT HE SAYS WE NEED COMMISSIONS TO PAY THE BILLS
ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS A JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES RETREATED ACROSS THE BOARD IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING AS THE DAY EARLIER DECLINE ON WALL STREET AND WEAKER DOLLAR PROMPTED WIDESPREAD PROFIT TAKING
BUT EQUITIES RECOVERED SOME OF THEIR EARLIER LOSSES LATE IN THE SESSION AND MOST PRICES CLOSED ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER
THE MARKET'S BULLISH MOMENTUM IS STILL INTACT TRADERS SAY CITING A FLOURISH OF LATE BUY ORDERS
MR.
<NOISE> WOODS A LEADER IN THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY FOR THIRTY YEARS SET THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STATION AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE
HE PAID WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH
THE COURT CANNOT UNDO HIS BAD BARGAIN THE COURT RULED
SINCE THOSE ROMAN DAYS OF COURSE THE JEWS HAVE BEEN THE WANDERERS OF THE EARTH
THERE IS HARDLY A CORNER OF IT WHERE SOME HAVE NOT SOUGHT REFUGE
IN MANY PLACES THEY FOUND IT BUT ONLY BRIEFLY
SOONER OR LATER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES STRANGERS IN THEIR NEW SOCIETY
AT FIRST PERHAPS THEY WERE ONLY SET ASIDE SEGREGATED IN WHERE THEY MIGHT LIVE AND WHAT WORK THEY MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO DO
HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLIER THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT BY THE GUANGDONG PROVINCE

INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
LAWRENCE SUMMERS ECONOMIC ADVISER TO GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AGREES THAT EVEN THE BEST FIGURES PROVIDE A DISCOURAGING PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY
IT USED TO BE THAT STANDARDS OF LIVING ROSE RELIABLY HE SAYS REFERRING TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES
BUT THE PACE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAS BEEN NEGATIVE BY MY PREFERRED MEASURE AND GLACIAL BY ANY OTHER
EXXON ALONE CUT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN COSTS JUST LAST YEAR
ONLY TWO YEARS AGO EIGHT HUNDRED EXXON EMPLOYEES OCCUPIED THIRTEEN FLOOR OF THE OIL GIANT'S NEW YORK SKYSCRAPER
TODAY AFTER LAYOFFS AND TRANSFERS ONLY THREE HUNDRED WORKERS REMAIN ON SEVEN FLOORS
AND THE BUILDING PART OF THE LEGACY OF EXXON FOUNDER JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER HAS BEEN SOLD TO A JAPANESE GROUP
<NOISE> IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
BUT I WON'T DO IT
I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
SUCH PLANS MAKE EDUCATORS CRINGE
THEY WORRY THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE COULD BE REDUCED TO A FEW TRIPS TO THE NOTES SUPERMARKET
MY GUESS IS THAT IT WILL QUICKLY BECOME WIDESPREAD BECAUSE OF PEER PRESSURE LAMENTS RANDY KNIGHT VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES IN OHIO STATE'S PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY ALSO HAVE FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
CATERPILLAR WON'T DISCUSS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE MOVE WHICH THE COMPANY SAYS WAS DONE TO REDUCE LABOR AND PARTS COSTS
BUT THE DOLLAR'S TWENTY PERCENT DECLINE AGAINST THE FRENCH FRANC SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE COULD HAVE INFLATED THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION COSTS BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
CATERPILLAR SAYS IT HEDGED AGAINST RISK FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE INTERBANK MARKET HELPING TO EASE THE FALLING DOLLAR'S NEGATIVE IMPACT
MOST INDIANS TRAVELING TO PAKISTAN MUST DO LIKEWISE
VISAS FOR EITHER COUNTRY TAKE ABOUT A MONTH TO OBTAIN
INDIANS TRAVELING IN PAKISTAN AND *PAKISTANIS* VISITING INDIA MUST SPELL OUT WELL IN ADVANCE WHICH CITIES THEY PLAN TO VISIT AND REGISTER WITH THE POLICE AT EVERY STOP
THEY RISK DETENTION IF THEY DEVIATE FROM THE ITINERARY
<NOISE> THE SYSTEM ISN'T ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN *SIMILARLY* REASSURED
EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL
EVENTUALLY SHARON SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEIR SHARES GIVING N. V. F. CONTROL
AT THE FIRST BOARD MEETING UNDER MR. POSNER SIX DIRECTORS RESIGNED
AN EMBITTERED MR. PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER
UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
BUT WESTIN HAS SHOWN UNSPECTACULAR ALBEIT STEADY EARNINGS IN RECENT YEARS AS COMPETITION HAS HEATED UP IN THE LUXURY HOTEL MARKET
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IT HAD OPERATING EARNINGS OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION ABOUT FOUR MILLION LESS THAN IT EARNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
REVENUE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT SIX MILLION
WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
I REGARD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AUTO RACING AND BOXING AS ONE OF DEGREE NOT KIND WITH AUTO RACING GETTING THE WORST OF THE COMPARISON
IN ADDITION I FAIL TO SEE AUTO RACING IN THE MAN AGAINST MAN DRAMA THAT SPORTS SHOULD GENERATE
<NOISE> TOO MUCH METAL AND TOO MANY CORPORATE STICKERS GET IN THE WAY
AS A RECENT VISIT REVEALED THE SOUP KITCHEN HAS BECOME A POWERFUL MAGNET DRAWING HUNDREDS WHO COME FOR MORE THAN JUST DAILY NOURISHMENT
MR. KOVACS AN OCTOGENARIAN WHO CROONS LOVE BALLADS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN COMES FOR CAMARADERIE
FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE

MR. SMILOW SAID THAT THE COMPANY WON'T HAVE TO SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS TO FINANCE A NEW BUY OUT
BUT IT WILL HAVE A LOT MORE DEBT THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY
AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED HE SAID PLAYTEX APPAREL WILL HAVE TOTAL DEBT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION
*PLAYTEX* HOLDINGS' DEBT WILL APPROACH ONE BILLION DOLLARS
OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS
THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAVE BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
<NOISE> ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN
NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD IDEA OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
MR. CASH OF HARVARD ADDS THERE IS A SHORTSIGHTEDNESS ON THE PART OF THE SUPPLIERS
BY REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTS AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTERS GIVE THE BUYER AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW ACROSS A BROADER LINE OF SUPPLIERS
HE SEES THE DAY WHEN AUTO MAKERS' COMPUTERS WILL SCAN THE COMPUTERS OF THEIR PRIMARY SUPPLIERS AND AUTOMATICALLY PLACE ORDERS WITH THE ONE OFFERING THE LOWEST PRICE
VISITS TO BOTH COUNTRIES HOWEVER LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LONG
FOR DEBT IN BRAZIL AS IN MEXICO IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION
THE OTHER IS FINDING THE RESOURCES AND THE WILL TO OVERCOME A MIRE OF POVERTY AND IGNORANCE
AND IN BOTH COUNTRIES THIS MIRE COULD ULTIMATELY PROVE POLITICALLY EXPLOSIVE
THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WANT TO USE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GIVE LABOR THINGS IT NOW HAS DIFFICULTY WINNING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE
CONGRESS GETS CREDIT FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYERS FOOT THE BILL
SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
<NOISE> T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
THE LEGISLATION PUTS SWISS INSIDER LAWS MORE IN LINE WITH THOSE OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
SWITZERLAND CURRENTLY ALLOWS THE INSIDER TO BE FREE BUT CAN PUNISH THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM A TIP
MEANWHILE AN INFORMAL PACT BETWEEN THE U. S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE SWISS BANKERS ASSOCIATION CONCERNING INSIDER TRADING INVESTIGATIONS HAS EXISTED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
THE PACT REQUIRES A CUSTOMER OF SWISS BANKS TO WAIVE SECRECY RIGHTS IF THE CUSTOMER IS LINKED TO AN INSIDER TRADING CASE BY THE S. E. C.
ROBERT H. SEWELL CHAIRMAN OF EQUITABLE BANKSHARES INCORPORATED A SMALL DALLAS BASED BANK HOLDING COMPANY WAS ASTONISHED AT THE OPULENCE
I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS BANK FURNITURE HE SAYS
BANKERS DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF STUFF
NEVERTHELESS HE ARRIVED WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASHIER'S CHECKS ENOUGH HE FIGURES TO OUTFIT HALF OF TWO NEW BRANCHES
USUALLY HE CALCULATES HE WOULD SPEND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUY THAT MUCH FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT
HE ALSO WAS IN THE MARKET FOR AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES AND OTHER BANKING EQUIPMENT
SOME ISSUERS ALSO ARE WARY OF DOING AWAY WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL
IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR
ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER
THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE BILL THAT AMERICA'S PARTNERS FIND NO LESS DISCONCERTING
COMPANIES THAT VIOLATE EXPORT CONTROLS FOR INSTANCE COULD BE BARRED FROM THE U. S. MARKET AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FIVE YEARS
ALSO PROBLEMATIC IN MY VIEW IS THAT THE U. S. WOULD CALL FOREIGN COMPANIES TO ACCOUNT FOR VIOLATIONS OF FOREIGN LAW COMMITTED ABROAD
RESTRICTING THE PRESIDENT'S SCOPE FOR ACTION REGARDING IMPORTS ALSO COULD TEND TO HARDEN INTERNATIONAL FRONTS
EACH DECADE SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES HAS SPAWNED A WELFARE REFORM MOVEMENT
THE FIRST OF THESE IN THE FORM OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S GREAT SOCIETY LED TO A MASSIVE GROWTH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE
THE SECOND TRIED TO AMEND THE INCENTIVES OF THE SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE WORK AND FAMILY STABILITY AND TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM INCOME FOR FAMILIES
THE REFORM MOVEMENT OF THE EIGHTIES COMBINES TOUGHER APPROACHES TO WORK REQUIREMENTS AND FAMILY SUPPORT WITH MORE GENEROUS AID FOR TRAINING
YET THE WELFARE BILL THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SIGN INTO LAW TOMORROW CONSTITUTES ONLY A MARGINAL CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM
MEANWHILE POVERTY CONTINUES WELFARE DEPENDENCY INCREASES AND THE UNDERCLASS EXPANDS
HIS BEST PITCH IS HIS SINKER AND IT'S A GREAT ONE
BUT HE'S GOT TO PINPOINT IT TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE AND THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO INNING AFTER INNING AND GAME AFTER GAME SAID DEMPSEY
HE WAS ABLE TO STAY IN A GROOVE LONGER THAN ANY PITCHER I'VE SEEN
IT'S STUDY ATTITUDE AND CONCENTRATION AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
<NOISE> ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEREVER I PUT MY GLOVE TONIGHT THURSDAY IT'S MOSTLY WHERE THE BALL WENT
<NOISE> THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAID SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
HE JOINED M. FIFTEEN STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
HE HAS A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A NICE MAN
CRITICS SAY HE IS CAPTIVATED BY HIS OWN ELOQUENCE
-TRUE HE SAYS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
REGARDLESS OF WHAT POLITICAL LABEL THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDS GEORGE BUSH AS A DECENT HONEST AND LIKABLE PERSON
AND MOST WOULD AGREE THAT HIS PERSONAL HISTORY HAS A STORYBOOK QUALITY ABOUT IT
SOMEBODY ONCE SAID GEORGE BUSH HAS LED THE LIFE THAT RONALD REAGAN PORTRAYS SAYS PETE TEELEY A LONGTIME AIDE
DREXEL'S MR. JOSEPH CALLS *STALEY'S* ALLEGATIONS OUTRAGEOUS
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOME OF THE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO MR. DAHL WERE MADE BUT SAYS THAT OTHERS WEREN'T
HE SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE DREXEL CUSTOMERS' HOLDINGS IN STALEY WERE EVER LARGE ENOUGH TO REQUIRE A THIRTEEN D. FILING
THE DEBARTOLOS BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO MAKE A BID FOR ZAYRE
THE FAMILY'S PERSONAL WEALTH IS ESTIMATED AT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY ARRANGED FINANCING FOR THE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR BIDS FOR ALLIED AND CARTER HAWLEY
THE DEBARTOLOS LOST OUT IN THE BIDDING FOR ALLIED TO CAMPEAU CORPORATION A TORONTO REAL ESTATE FIRM
CARTER HAWLEY AVOIDED A TAKEOVER THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING
KENYA SAID DOZENS OF UGANDAN SOLDIERS ENTERED ITS TERRITORY AND CLASHED WITH POLICE
TWO UGANDAN SOLDIERS WERE REPORTED KILLED
NAIROBI WHICH SAID THE UGANDAN TROOPS WERE UNPROVOKED FILED A PROTEST OVER THE UNWARRANTED VIOLATION OF ITS BORDER
<NOISE> BUT SCALI MCCABE WON'T BE EARNING COMMISSIONS FROM THE PURCHASE OF MEDIA SPOTS FOR KIDS R. US
MEDIA PLACEMENT FOR THE UNIT LIKE ITS PARENT IS DONE BY OTHER FIRMS
SCALI MCCABE WILL INSTEAD BE PAID ON A NEGOTIATED FEE BASIS FOR CREATING THE ADS
THE FEES WEREN'T DISCLOSED
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
AND AN INTERMARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST
MANY FUND MANAGERS HERE SAY AMERICA ISN'T TAKING THE STRONG MEDICINE NEEDED TO CURB HIGH CONSUMER SPENDING IMPROVE LOW PERSONAL SAVINGS RATES AND COMBAT THE STUBBORN DUAL DEFICITS
THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY PROGRESS BEFORE THE NEW U. S. PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR AND SAY BOTH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES PROBABLY WILL RISE
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION
IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
<NOISE> THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO FRONTS
ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES
ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUY OUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
<NOISE> AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
ONE NEW DIRECTORATE MEMBER ISN'T LIKELY TO CHANGE *BUNDESBANK* POLICY
BUT *BUNDESBANK* WATCHERS EXPECT MR. TIETMEYER TO SIDE WITH MR. POEHL'S MONETARY POLICIES WHICH EMPHASIZE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OVER UNILATERAL ACTIONS
<NOISE> OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE FREQUENTLY CLASHED WITH MR. POEHL OVER HIS EFFORT TO COORDINATE WEST GERMAN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE MOVES WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN WASHINGTON HAS LOST TRACK OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> ITS TRACKERS FIGURE THAT AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKETS AND AROUND THE HOUSE
<NOISE> BUT THAT IS ONLY ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT OF THE BILLS AND LOOSE CHANGE THEY CAN'T DIRECTLY ACCOUNT FOR
HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING <NOISE>
IT'S NOT A FLUKE
IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
MANGA FITS NICELY INTO A LIFE STYLE THAT PROVIDES LITTLE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE'S FANTASIES
FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHOSE DAYS ACTUALLY ARE SPENT STUDYING BECOME COMIC BOOK SECRET AGENTS AND SOLDIERS
AND A FREQUENT MANGA THEME IS A BOY'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS BUXOM TEACHER
MUCH OF THE OPTIMISM FUELING WESTERN FINANCIAL FLOWS TO THE SOVIETS IS A REACTION TO MR. GORBACHEV'S GLASNOST
BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL STILL BE IN POWER WHEN THE SOVIETS OWE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS
ANOTHER REFORM MINDED LEADER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV TRIED TO KICK START THE SOVIET ECONOMY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AND WAS SENT PACKING
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT FOLLOWED
EVEN IF MR. GORBACHEV SHOULD DELIVER HIS PROMISED REFORMS THERE IS REASON TO DOUBT HE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET PAYMENTS ON ALL THESE NEW LOANS
HUNGARY BEGAN ITS FLIRTATION WITH MARKET ECONOMICS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT YET TODAY IS IN THE MIDST OF A SEVERE DEBT CRUNCH
MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
<NOISE> I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
BUT THAT WAS AN ABERRATION
<NOISE> DICK DOESN'T GET HIGHS AND LOWS LIKE THE REST OF US SAYS D- OKLAHOMA DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN MIKE SYNAR A FRIEND AND BACKER
HE'S LIKE THE STAR QUARTERBACK STEADY
THE TEAM KNOWS HE'S THE BEST HOPE THEY'VE GOT
ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
<NOISE> UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
<NOISE> MOTIVES ARE MIXED
SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
FURTHER SIGNS OF STRONG U. S. ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FROM A LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORT NEXT FRIDAY ON THE NATION'S EMPLOYMENT PICTURE FOR AUGUST
<NOISE> IF SO FEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIALS MAY RAISE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES FURTHER WITHIN A FEW WEEKS SEVERAL ANALYSTS SAID
THEY ALSO PREDICTED THAT BANKS WILL RAISE THEIR PRIME OR BASE RATES AGAIN TO TEN AND A HALF PERCENT OR ELEVEN PERCENT FROM THE CURRENT TEN PERCENT LEVEL
<NOISE> AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE
DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES
AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW
ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT
BUT THE COMPANY ALSO IS SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOME BASIC STRATEGIC ERRORS
FOR EXAMPLE ADVANCED MICRO WAS SLOW TO BEGIN PRODUCING CHIPS MADE WITH A FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY CALLED COMPLEMENTARY METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR OR CMOS
THEY USE LESS POWER AND RUN FASTER THAN CONVENTIONAL CHIPS BUT ADVANCED MICRO REMAINED COMMITTED TO AN OLDER TECHNOLOGY UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
<NOISE> GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION <NOISE> LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE TOP SPOT
WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT <NOISE>
IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
<NOISE> IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT SAINT
LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
THEN CAME THE AIR WARS
AFTER DECONTROL NINE MORE AIRLINES INVADED THE MARKET ALL TRYING TO LURE A SHARE OF THE TWENTY MILLION TRAVELERS WHO USE THIS AIRPORT EACH YEAR
IN ASIAN TRADING YESTERDAY THE DOLLAR REBOUNDED FROM WHAT SOME TRADERS SAID WAS AN OVERSOLD CONDITION
WEDNESDAY'S DECLINE TRIGGERED BUY ORDERS AND SOME TRADERS BOUGHT DOLLARS TO COVER SHORT OR OVERSOLD POSITIONS
BUT AFTER CLIMBING TO INTRADAY HEIGHTS OF ONE POINT EIGHT OH FIVE FIVE MARKS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE POINT SIXTY SIX YEN THE DOLLAR BEGAN SINKING AGAIN
SOUTHLAND WOULD HAVE ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED
THE COMPANY PLANS TO PAY OFF ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LARGELY FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS
SOUTHLAND EXPECTS PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES TO TOTAL EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR
BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS ECONOMIC GROWTH TO REBOUND AFTER THE EFFECTS OF THE STOCK MARKET CRASH WANE
IT FORECASTS A THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT GROWTH RATE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETEEN NINETY AND STEADILY FALLING INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION RATES
BUT FORECASTERS INSIDE GOVERNMENT AND OUT HAVE A POOR RECORD IN PREDICTING ECONOMIC TRENDS THAT FAR IN THE FUTURE
FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE <NOISE>
MOREOVER SOME HOUSING SPECIALISTS SAY PERMIT ACTIVITY IS A POOR INDICATOR OF FUTURE STARTS ARGUING THAT IT REFLECTS CURRENT HOUSING ACTIVITY RATHER THAN PREDICTING FUTURE ACTIVITY
THEY PREDICT THAT INSTEAD OF FALLING HOUSING STARTS WILL IMPROVE IN COMING MONTHS IN REACTION TO INCREASING NEW AND EXISTING HOME SALES
ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS TREND WILL BE THE SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS BEEN BATTERED BY RECESSION AND A HOUSING GLUT
ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
BUT MR. EDELL HAS ARGUED THAT MRS. CIPOLLONE HEARD CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF HER HABIT
IN A DEPOSITION READ TO THE COURT IN APRIL MRS. CIPOLLONE SAID SHE WAS INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO SMOKING BECAUSE OF ITS SEDUCTIVE CONNOTATIONS OF HOLLYWOOD AND GLAMOUR
THE CIGARETTE MAKERS' ADVERTISEMENTS REINFORCED THESE PERCEPTIONS AND OTHERS OF THE PRODUCT'S SAFETY THE PLAINTIFF CONTENDS
MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT
MR. ICAHN WANTS TO GIVE HOLDERS A MIXTURE OF TWENTY DOLLARS A SHARE IN CASH AND ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A SHARE FACE AMOUNT OF DEBENTURES
ON SOME LEDGERS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO ADD TO UP TO FIFTY DOLLARS
BUT SOME INSIDERS APPARENTLY PREFER THIRTY SIX TO THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS IN CASH
FOUR T. W. A. VICE PRESIDENTS THREE CURRENT ONE DEPARTED RECENTLY SOLD ALL THEIR SHARES AT THOSE PRICES
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT

SUEZ WHICH HAD TO RAISE ITS CAPITAL SEVERAL TIMES LAST YEAR THROUGH RIGHTS ISSUES TO FUND ITS BELGIAN BATTLE SAYS IT CAN FUND ITS ACQUISITION OF C.
INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD OR THROUGH SHORT TERM LOANS

INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF C.

MR. SCANLON EXPECTS BUSINESS TO BEGIN TAILING OFF ONLY AFTER APRIL FIFTEENTH UNTIL THEN PEOPLE WILL STILL BE MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO I. R. A.S FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS EVEN IF THEY'RE MADE IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN QUALIFY FOR A FULL TAX DEDUCTION
A PERSON WHO PUTS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO AN I. R. A. CAN DEDUCT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX GROSS INCOME IN DETERMINING TAXABLE INCOME
DEPENDING ON THE PERSON'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TAX BRACKET THAT CAN SAVE UP TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAXES
MR. CRUZ SAID HE HAD SET DEADLINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORMS HE WAS PROPOSING
HE SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE EXPECTED THAT THE INTEGRATION OF A NEW REBEL ARMY WOULD BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF JUNE

THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORP. <NOISE> A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO IGNORE THE SORRY PERFORMANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT GORDON WOULD RECALL
THEY WERE ABLE MEN YET THEY MANAGED TO DO A WRETCHED JOB

IN THE MEANTIME HE WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO GET MORE OF THE COMPANY'S VALUE INTO THE HANDS OF SHAREHOLDERS
I'M POSITIVE ON THE MOVE TO HIS NEW POST MR. RHINES SAID
I GREW UP IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR GROUP
MR. RHINES HELD A NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN THE COMPANY'S SEMICONDUCTOR OPERATIONS BEFORE TAKING THE DATA SYSTEMS JOB IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE

THESE ARE VERY INTERESTING TIMES SAID RICHARD SHAFFER AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT AND ANALYST WHO PUBLISHES TECHNOLOGIC COMPUTER LETTER
A YEAR AGO IT SEEMED THAT I. B. M. AND MICROSOFT ALONE WOULD DICTATE THE STANDARDS FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS IN THE OFFICE
NOW AFTER APPLE'S LAWSUIT CHALLENGING MICROSOFT AND SUN COMING UP WITH OPEN LOOK FOR UNIX WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING THREE VERY COMPETITIVE STANDARDS
FINALLY THERE'S THE WELFARE PROBLEM
NOT ALL WORKERS ARE AS LUCKY AS JOSEPH
SOME GET SICK OR INJURED AND LOSE THEIR JOBS
OTHERS WHO TURNED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS OVER TO BROKERS IN ORDER TO GET HERE DISCOVER THAT PROMISES OF MONEY MEALS AND LODGING WERE BOGUS

I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
WHILE HE BELIEVES THE DOLLAR WILL MOVE LOWER AGAINST THE MAJOR CURRENCIES THE SOFTENING EXPORT MARKET IS PRESSURING JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN EXPORTERS
THAT OF COURSE IS LIMITING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THESE COMPANY STOCKS
THESE STOCKS HAVE GONE UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLE IS MUCH HIGHER ABROAD THAN HERE
THAT WOULD MAKE NON DOLLAR EQUITY INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE
LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED SAID IT ARRANGED A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FINANCING THROUGH ISSUANCE OF PROMISSORY NOTES TO A GROUP OF TWENTY TWO LENDERS

THOSE EDITORS WHO HAVE PLUNGED IN ARE FINDING THAT AN ELECTRONIC OFFSHOOT CAN HELP THEM PUT OUT A MAGAZINE
<NOISE> BIX USERS HAVE SEEN THEIR ELECTRONIC MUSINGS FIND THEIR WAY INTO PRINT IN BYTE IN A SECTION CALLED BEST OF BIX
NOT LONG AGO BYTE EDITORS WANDERING THROUGH BIX WERE STRUCK BY INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS FROM A SUBSCRIBER IN SAN DIEGO
<NOISE> <NOISE> TODAY THE SUBSCRIBER BROCK MEEKS IS A REGULAR BYTE CONTRIBUTOR ONE OF SEVERAL THE MAGAZINE HAS RECRUITED FROM BIX
THE CRACK EPIDEMIC HAS JUST ABOUT SILENCED LIBERAL OPPOSITION TO TOUGH LAW AND ORDER POLICIES
IT IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS TO TALK ABOUT REHABILITATING AN UZI TOTING DRUG PUSHER WHO MAKES FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK
HIS PROBLEM IS NOT LACK OF SELF ESTEEM
<NOISE> THERE IS NOTHING A SOCIAL WORKER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SOCIAL WORKER IS TOO AFRAID TO VENTURE INTO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD
WHETHER THE EAST GERMAN GOVERNMENT CAN EXTRICATE ITSELF FROM ITS CURRENT CRISIS IS A QUESTION THAT CONFOUNDS WESTERN ANALYSTS
HOWEVER MOST AGREE THAT EAST GERMANY IS LURCHING TOWARD CRISIS
ABOVE ALL IT IS A CRISIS THAT THE NATION'S AGING LEADERS SEEM UTTERLY CONFUSED BY
WITH THE REST OF THE EAST BLOC SWEPT UP IN A TIDE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE EAST BERLIN HAS STEADFASTLY STUCK TO ITS OLD WAYS
<NOISE> YET THE GOVERNMENT LED BY SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD ERICH HONECKER APPEARS ALMOST INCAPABLE OF GOVERNING AT A TIME THAT DEMANDS NEW IDEAS
THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PREMARIN BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP.'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
<NOISE> IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF PREMARIN LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID PREMARIN ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
BUT NEITHER EUROPEANS NOR AMERICANS SEEM ESPECIALLY EAGER
SOME EVEN CONTEND THAT CONVENTIONAL DEFENSES ARE ADEQUATE OR ARE GROWING IRRELEVANT
NOT SO INSISTS MR. ABSHIRE WHO BELIEVES ENHANCING NATO'S CAPABILITIES IS OF ACCELERATING IMPORTANCE
<NOISE> IN THE CREDIT MARKETS FRIDAY RATES ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS ROSE

THE JAPANESE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HECK OF A TIME SELLING TWO POINT THREE MILLION CARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
I'M NOT SURE HOLDING QUOTAS DOES THEM ANY HARM
LORIMAR TELEPICTURES CORP. OFFERED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ELEVEN PERCENT SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY NINE THROUGH DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED

EXCO A UNIT OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS P. L. C. IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BROKERS OF INTERBANK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSITS
<NOISE> UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT HOLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
<NOISE> R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
THE RESULT IS A CONSERVATISM COMPOSED OF CONSERVATIVES WHO DO NOT INTEGRATE THEIR NARROW VALUES INTO THE BROAD RANGE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE
<NOISE> THEIR VIEWS ARE SOUND ENOUGH BUT EACH IS ONLY ONE RECIPE ON LIFE'S MENU
<NOISE> YET THEY MUST ALL BE VEGETARIANS
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HEALTH DOESN'T REMAIN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE
GREYHOUND CORP. WHICH INSTITUTED A COMPANYWIDE SMOKING BAN LAST YEAR SAYS IT WON'T CONSIDER EXEMPTING THE NEW CIGARETTE FROM THE BAN UNLESS IT IS PROVED SAFE
AT GREYHOUND WE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS HARMFUL TO EMPLOYEES' HEALTH ON THE PREMISE SAYS JOHN W. TEETS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
<NOISE> NO ONE HAS COME OUT AND SAID THIS IS A HEALTHY CIGARETTE
TRADERS SAID THE CURRENT BEAR MARKET COULD ENJOY A SHORT RALLY AT SOME POINT
THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY BIG GAINS HOWEVER UNLESS THE U. S. ANNOUNCES SIGNIFICANT CUTS IN ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
THAT IS WHAT THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR A BRITISH TRADER SAID
<NOISE> THAT IS THE CONFIDENCE BOOSTING FACTOR
<NOISE> THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
AT STAKE COULD BE ITS STANDING AS THE WORLD'S NUMBER SEVEN AND EUROPE'S NUMBER THREE TIRE MAKER
AS AUTO MAKERS BECOME GLOBAL TIRE MAKERS ARE FOLLOWING
BECAUSE PIRELLI EXPORTS ONLY SPECIALTY TIRES TO THE U. S. AND HAS NO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THERE IT LACKS BRAND NAME RECOGNITION AND NEEDS A PARTNER ANALYSTS SAY
BUT WITH THREE ACQUISITION TARGETS FIRESTONE ARMSTRONG TIRE COMPANY AND GENERAL TIRE AND RUBBER COMPANY ALREADY TAKEN FEW OPTIONS ARE LEFT
SEPARATELY THE LABOR DEPARTMENT SAID AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS OF U. S. WORKERS FELL POINT THREE PERCENT IN MARCH AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION AND SEASONAL FACTORS
EARNINGS FELL A REVISED POINT FOUR PERCENT IN FEBRUARY
BEFORE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS ROSE POINT SEVEN PERCENT BUT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED EACH WEEK FELL POINT SIX PERCENT
THE COMPANY SAID LIFE INSURANCE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS HAD RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
IT IS SAID THAT FINANCE UNIT EARNINGS ROSE FORTY ONE PERCENT AND THAT ITS LEASING UNIT HAD RECORD RESULTS BECAUSE OF HIGH UTILIZATION RATES
CONSUMER LENDING ALONG WITH TAX AND TITLE OPERATIONS DECLINED REFLECTING LAGGING BUT NOW IMPROVING REAL ESTATE SALES THE COMPANY SAID
THE RESULTS ARE MIXED THERE IS LESS TO FINANCE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS BUT MORE TO PAY FOR PRIVATE CONSUMPTION
SPAIN'S UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS CONTRIBUTING TO AN ECONOMIC BOOM
GROWTH THIS YEAR MAY REACH NEARLY FIVE PERCENT MORE THAN DOUBLE THE TWO POINT THREE PERCENT FORECAST FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE
AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
THOUSANDS OF AZERBAIJAN WORKERS RALLIED IN THE SOVIET REPUBLIC'S CAPITAL BAKU AFTER A DAY OF WORK STOPPAGES TO BACK DEMANDS FOR GREATER LOCAL A- AUTONOMY
IN ESTONIA THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF URGED ETHNIC RUSSIAN WORKERS TO END A SIX DAY STRIKE OVER A NEW LAW TIGHTENING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES
GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO S- SHORTAGE OF INMATES TO FILL NEW FACILITIES
ALTHOUGH SOME CABINET MINISTERS HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN THE MASS ACTION TOOK MANY BY SURPRISE
MR. BENIGNO SAID TALK OF RESIGNING STARTED DURING A CABINET MEETING
ASKED WHAT CAUSED THE RESIGNATION OFFERS MR. BENIGNO SAID YOU'D HAVE TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE PANORAMA OF EVENTS SINCE THE AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH COUP
<NOISE> WHAT LIES AHEAD
<NOISE> MR. BERG CONTENDS THAT INVESTORS SHOULD BE DIVING INTO STOCKS PICKING UP EASY PROFITS IN THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS
A SIX MONTH RALLY IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AND NINETEEN SIXTY TWO MARKET DROPS HE EXPLAINS
<NOISE> NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTION HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTION TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
NO ONE HAS LESS CREDIBILITY THAN THE MAN DIRECTLY IN CHARGE OF CENTRAL AMERICAN POLICY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER AMERICAN AFFAIRS ELLIOTT ABRAMS
SOME CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES REFUSE TO HEAR HIM AT ALL OTHERS WILL LISTEN ONLY IF HE TESTIFIES UNDER OATH
<NOISE> ONLY LAST WEEK THE SENATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE THREW HIM OUT OF A CLOSED BRIEFING ON THE ALLEGED INVASION
WHY ANYONE SHOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY ANYTHING MR. ABRAMS SAYS ABOUT CENTRAL AMERICA DEFIES COMPREHENSION
<NOISE> NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
ALMOST UNNOTICED IN DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
INSTEAD WHAT SOME CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE *DEBUT* OF COSBY
<NOISE> BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT
THAT'S HIS SPECIALTY TEACHING CANDIDATES HOW TO PERFORM ON T. V. COACHING POLITICIANS FOR DEBATES IS A SPECIALTY WITHIN A SPECIALTY
AS A COACH SAYS BOB GOODMAN OF BALTIMORE ANOTHER MEDIA CONSULTANT ROGER AILES IS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF
I SEND MY OWN CLIENTS TO HIM
<NOISE> ANALYSTS SAY THEY EXPECT P. AND G'S MOMENTUM TO CARRY INTO NINETEEN NINETY AND BEYOND AND MANY RAISED THEIR FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY ESTIMATES
BRENDA LEE LANDRY OF MORGAN STANLEY RAISED HER ESTIMATE TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS FROM AN EARLIER ESTIMATE OF EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS
KIDDER'S MR. FREEDMAN AND JOSEPH KOZLOFF AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT RAISED THEIR ESTIMATES TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE FROM EIGHT DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS
I CAN SEE A NUMBER CLOSE TO TEN DOLLARS FOR NINETEEN NINETY ONE SAYS MR. KOZLOFF
<NOISE> TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION
SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
<NOISE> IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
JOHN SLOAN'S PEOPLE ARE LARGELY TAKEN FOR GRANTED BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY HAVE BEEN THE STARS OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
<NOISE> AS BIG CORPORATIONS HAVE LAID OFF WORKERS BY THE THOUSANDS TO MEET COMPETITIVE PRESSURES SMALL FIRMS HAVE MORE THAN CUSHIONED THE BLOW
THEY HAVE CREATED SOME TEN MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE MADE AT LAST YEAR'S WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS
<NOISE> MOREOVER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS THE RULE MAINLY BECAUSE SMALL ENTREPRENEURS MAKE THEIR OWN OPPORTUNITIES
BY ONE ESTIMATE WOMEN NOW ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF NEW BUSINESS START UPS IN THE U. S.
GENERAL SECORD SAID HE WAS STUNNED TO LEARN THAT DAY OF ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S RESIGNATION AND COLONEL NORTH'S FIRING
BESIEGED BY CALLS FROM THE PRESS HE SAID HE WENT TO A HOTEL NEAR HIS OFFICE
HE SAID COLONEL NORTH MET HIM THERE AND RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM PRESIDENT REAGAN AND VICE PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH THANKING HIM FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT
<NOISE> PRESIDENT HUSSEIN'S DOMESTIC STRATEGY AIMED AT SAVING HIS OWN SKIN HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI WANTS IRAQIS TO GIVE HIM MR. HUSSEIN'S HEAD AND END THE WAR
HOWEVER MR. HUSSEIN HAS THUS FAR CONVINCED HIS PEOPLE AND FELLOW LEADERS THAT HIS AND HIS NATION'S FATE ARE THE SAME
<NOISE> A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
<NOISE> WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
WHO GOT HER VOTE LAST SEPTEMBER
GENERAL
-(B)USSI SHE SAYS
<NOISE> I THINK WE NEED A HARD HAND
OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
WE'LL SEE
WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
<NOISE> MEANWHILE THE SECURITIES FIRM'S PARENT COMPANY PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA REPORTED MODEST GAINS IN MOST FINANCIAL CATEGORIES
PRUDENTIAL'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS ROSE FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
CURRENT BENEFITS TO POLICYHOLDERS ROSE TWO POINT NINE PERCENT TO FOURTEEN POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE DIVIDENDS AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX INCHED UP TO TWO POINT SIX FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
FELDMUEHLE SHARES ROSE SIXTEEN MARKS YESTERDAY ON FRANKFURT'S STOCK EXCHANGE TO THREE OH NINE POINT FIVE MARKS
<NOISE> BROKERS CITED STRONG FOREIGN DEMAND WHICH DROVE UP TRADING VOLUME IN FELDMUEHLE TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES NEARLY FOUR TIMES RECENT LEVELS
BUT THE BROKERS SAID THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ONLY ONE PARTY WAS ACCUMULATING MOST OF THE SHARES
I WAS SHOCKED SAYS MR. KUHLENSCHMIDT
I SAID THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE
I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY STARTED SELLING TIES IN SIZES
BUT I LOOKED AND THERE WASN'T A SIZE ON IT
<NOISE> ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE PRICE EARNINGS RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
MOREOVER MR. FAIR'S PREDICTIONS TEND TO IMPROVE WITH AGE
<NOISE> BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX HE WAS GIVING PRESIDENT FORD THE INCUMBENT'S FOUR POINT ADVANTAGE
<NOISE> AFTER THE ELECTION HE TOOK IT AWAY
UNLIKE LYNDON JOHNSON MR. FORD WASN'T EVER ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT MR. FAIR EXPLAINS FEEBLY
WHEN MR. FAIR PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF HIS EQUATION TODAY IT STILL SHOWS A FORD VICTORY BUT BY A LESS EMBARRASSING MARGIN
THIS NOVEL ECONOMIC APPROACH IGNORES THE MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT CENTRAL BANK INTERVENTION AND ALL THAT MUMBO JUMBO
THAT'S NOT HOW THEY TEACH ECONOMICS AT HAMBURGER UNIVERSITY INSTEAD THE BIG MAC INDEX SIMPLY LOOKS AT WORLD WIDE PRICES OF HAMBURGERS AT TODAY'S EXCHANGE RATES
THAT QUICKLY SHOWS WHICH CURRENCIES ARE TOO STRONG OR WEAK AND BY HOW MUCH
<NOISE> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMMODITY COIN IS INDONESIA HURT BY WEAK PETROLEUM PRICES AND LAGGING AGRICULTURAL GROWTH
<NOISE> INDONESIA HAS BOOSTED NON OIL EXPORTS THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME OIL AND GAS WILL ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN HALF THE NATION'S EXPORT EARNINGS
THE BRIGHT SPOT CONTINUES TO BE MANUFACTURED EXPORTS LED BY PLYWOOD AND TEXTILES
IF HOLLYWOOD'S INSURERS TOIL IN A WORLD OF MAKE BELIEVE THEY MUST STILL COME UP WITH REAL LIFE WAYS TO MINIMIZE THEIR LOSSES
<NOISE> THE SPECIAL EFFECTS FOR GHOSTBUSTERS TWO REQUIRED A BATTERY OF HOT LIGHTS AND EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED THE STUDIO'S SPRINKLER SYSTEM
THE SPRINKLERS WERE TURNED OFF BUT THE INSURER DEMANDED THAT A FIRE COMPANY BE ON THE SET AT ALL TIMES
THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH
COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
<NOISE> THE SALE COMPLETES ALLIED'S PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DIVESTITURE OF ITS ELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION BUSINESSES
<NOISE> THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM INVOLVED THE SALE OF SEVEN COMPANIES INCLUDING NEPTUNE
<NOISE> PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT CONTINUE THE COMPANY'S SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM AND FOR INVESTMENTS
WITHIN TWO HOURS DAYTON HUDSON COMMON HIT FIFTY NINE DOLLARS A SHARE ON THE BIG BOARD AND UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS IN OTHER MARKETS
PEOPLE TOOK POSITIONS IN THE STOCK SIMPLY ON THE RUMOR OF A TAKEOVER BY SOMEONE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN BOESKY WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON HUDSON HOWEVER WERE MAD
SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE A TROUT TO THE FLY
<NOISE> THAT LEAVES RETAIL BROKERAGE FIRMS WITH A STARK CHOICE
THEY CAN MOVE ONTO THE INSTITUTIONAL FIRMS' TURF AND FIGHT FOR A TOP SPOT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
<NOISE> OR THEY CAN SETTLE INTO THE SECOND RANK OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS PERHAPS FOREVER
THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT
IN CONTRAST IF THE UTILITY BEGAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THEY THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW HE SAID
<NOISE> IN EITHER CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE UTILITY'S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED HE SAID
<NOISE> ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
<NOISE> THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
MR. REICHLER RECENTLY STUNNED SOME LIBERALS WHEN HE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS QUEST TO WIN U. S. AID FOR ITS POLICE FORCE AND MILITARY
SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA ALSO GOT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
<NOISE> ADMINISTRATORS BLAME THE HIGH COST OF CARE ON SUCH FACTORS AS RISING SALARIES WHICH THEY SAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS SIXTY PERCENT OF EXPENSES
THEY SAY A NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE FORCES THEM TO PAY BONUSES FOR QUALIFIED HELP
BUT EVEN AT THIS PRICE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS
<NOISE> SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVICE CAUSED INFECTIONS THAT LED TO SEVERE COMPLICATIONS
ROBINS STILL CONTENDS OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURIES
THE COMPANY ALSO INSISTS THE SHIELD ISN'T ANY MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHER I. U. D.S
NE WIN'S SINGLE PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM LONG HAS BEEN UNPOPULAR BUT IT HAS REMAINED IN POWER LARGELY BECAUSE OF MILITARY SUPPORT
IN HIS TWENTY SIX YEAR RULE NE WIN TRANSFORMED BURMA FROM ONE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA'S RICHEST SOCIETIES TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES
<NOISE> UNDER HIS BURMESE WAY TO SOCIALISM THE STATE TOOK CONTROL OF ALMOST ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE
THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
OUR PROBLEM IS GETTING THIS VERY VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY WORK SAYS ANTHONY SIMONDS GOODING BRITISH SATELLITE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
OUR CREDIBILITY IS CLOSE TO ZERO UNTIL THEN
SOME ANALYSTS TAKE A HARSHER VIEW
THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION MARK OVER B. S. B. MANAGEMENT SAYS MARK ASTAIRE A MEDIA ANALYST AT U. K. BROKERS HOARE GOVETT LIMITED
SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
HE JOINED M. I. FIVE STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
A SOURCE CLOSE TO TEXACO SAID THAT WHILE TEXACO IS ANXIOUS TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER ELEVEN IT ISN'T IN THE COMPANY'S OR SHAREHOLDERS' INTEREST TO RUSH INTO A SETTLEMENT
IT'S NORMAL FOR CREDITORS TO WANT A QUICK SETTLEMENT
BUT TEXACO'S SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A BIG SAY IN THIS CASE AND THEY AREN'T PUSHING FOR A SETTLEMENT FOR SETTLEMENT'S SAKE THE SOURCE SAID
<NOISE> BUT ON TUESDAY KIDDER PEABODY'S JACK KIRNAN DROPPED CHRYSLER TO A HOLD RATING
VANS AND TRUCKS ARE SELLING WELL HE CONCEDES BUT CHRYSLER'S CAR SALES HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING
HE ALSO FIGURES CHRYSLER WILL TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AMERICAN MOTORS WHICH IT ACQUIRED WEDNESDAY
BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
THE MINISTERS NEXT WILL GO TO KUWAIT THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND IRAQ ALL SAID TO BE PRODUCING BEYOND THEIR QUOTAS
FINAL STOPS ON THIS LEG OF THE TOUR WILL BE QATAR AND IRAN
A SECOND TRIP TO OTHER OPEC COUNTRIES IS SET FOR NOVEMBER
THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CREATION OF SUPERREGIONAL BANKS MIGHT NOT BE OPEN LONG
THEN WE WILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF CONSOLIDATING OUR POSITIONS
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
WHAT HAS DISTINGUISHED US IS THAT OUR RETURNS ON ASSETS AND EQUITY ARE FAR ABOVE AVERAGE
MAINTAINING THOSE LEVELS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE
YET HE STRIVES TO REASSURE CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS CALLING HIMSELF A SCANDINAVIAN STYLE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT WHO APPRECIATES THE BENEFITS OF CAPITALISM
THERE'S NO MINDLESS ATTEMPT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAX PRIVATE CORPORATIONS OUT OF EXISTENCE HE SAYS
THAT'S SILLY YOU DON'T DO THAT
YOU WANT THEM TO DO WELL
BUT SCALI MCCABE WON'T BE EARNING COMMISSIONS FROM THE PURCHASE OF MEDIA SPOTS FOR KIDS R. US
MEDIA PLACEMENT FOR THE UNIT LIKE ITS PARENT IS DONE BY OTHER FIRMS
SCALI MCCABE WILL INSTEAD BE PAID ON A NEGOTIATED FEE BASIS FOR CREATING THE ADS
THE FEES WEREN'T DISCLOSED
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCKS INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
BANKERS TRUST'S QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
BUT THE BANK HAD NET RECOVERIES OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF NET CHARGE OFFS IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
AND THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES REMAINED UNCHANGED AT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION ARE TO BE SCRUTINIZED CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY
THOSE INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS AREN'T LIKELY TO WIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
CHINA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPROVE MOST INVESTMENTS IN EXPORT RELATED INDUSTRIES AND IN PROJECTS COVERING ENERGY TRANSPORT COMMUNICATIONS RAW MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS
A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS IS ALREADY WREAKING HAVOC IN MANY OF CHINA'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES
A FACTORY THAT MAKES NIKE SHOES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE HAS TO RUN A GENERATOR THREE DAYS A WEEK TO STAY IN OPERATION
THE PLANT'S TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ARE STOCKPILING COAL AND OIL FOR POWER IN CASE THEIR SUPPLIES GET CUT OFF
MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE
MEANWHILE CIVIL RICO CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES
FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS WHO CONSULTED ME HAD SUBMITTED THE LOW BID FOR A LARGE MARINA TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON LAKE MICHIGAN
THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL RICO ACTION CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD
NO MATTER WHAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUIT THE LOW BIDDERS ALREADY HAVE FELT THE STING OF SUCH POISONOUS WORDS AS RACKETEER
SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS *SERIOUSLY* THAN THEY USED TO
IN PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL *BAROMETERS* SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INC. IN PHILADELPHIA
THEY ARE NOT THE MOST SCIENTIFIC THINGS AROUND
MR. WALTER WOULD BE RICH IF NOT FOR HIS AWFUL BUSINESS SENSE SAYS HIS BROTHER DANIEL A MARKETING EXECUTIVE
MY MOTHER SAYS GO HELP YOUR BROTHER
I SAY THE ONLY WAY I COULD HELP HIM IS WITH A GARBAGE TRUCK TO HAUL AWAY THE OLD COMPUTER MANUALS THAT LITTER HIS APARTMENT
LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED
BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY
AND AS THE CANADIAN UNIT RISES IT LURES MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY FROM JAPAN WHICH ADDS TO ITS STRENGTH <NOISE>
IN VIEDMA MEANWHILE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OSCAR MACHADO EXUDES PROVINCIAL CONFIDENCE
HE HAS PUT UP A SIGN IN THE MAIN SQUARE WELCOMING VISITORS TO THE NEW FEDERAL CAPITAL
HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES HIS CORNER OF PATAGONIA WILL SOON BE ADORNED WITH NEW ROADS TELEPHONES EMBASSIES AND HOTELS
HE SAYS HE EXPECTS PRESIDENT ALFONSIN TO START COMING REGULARLY NEXT YEAR
IN MORE RECENT TIMES THE LEGAL PROFESSION HAS AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB THAT LOOKED AFTER ITS OWN
SQUABBLES WERE SETTLED BEHIND THE COURTHOUSE
LAWYERLY MISDEEDS WERE HUSHED UP OR HU:RRIEDLY RESOLVED
CLIENTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SCANDALOUS TO SUE THE FAMILY OR COMPANY LAWYER
GENERAL RAMOS ALSO CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES WERE LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED
GENERAL RAMOS SAID THE MILITARY WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN PERSONNEL NEAR ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS DURING THE UPRISING
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
THE BLACKSTONE FUND BLACKSTONE CAPITAL PARTNERS L. P. IS SEEKING TO RAISE ONE BILLION DOLLARS
IT HAS ALREADY GATHERED SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION FUND OFFICIALS SAID
THE FUND'S LIMITED PARTNERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE LARGEST MOST POWERFUL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD SAID PETER G. PETERSON BLACKSTONE GROUP'S CHAIRMAN
DISCUSSING THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT NORMAN BAILEY A WASHINGTON BASED CONSULTANT AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SAID IT'S RIDICULOUS
IT'S WORSE THAN A JERRY BUILT HOUSE <NOISE>
FROM THE BANKS' STANDPOINT HE CHARACTERIZED THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT AS ALMOST WORSE THAN LENDING THEMSELVES THE MONEY
HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
HE WAS VERY *REFRESHING* IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY <NOISE>
G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S <NOISE>
FINALLY THROUGH THE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS OF THE COLOR OF BLOOD RESTS IN THE CREATION OF BEM AND HIS STUMBLING JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY
AT LAST HE FINDS A MOMENT OF INNER PEACE AND JOY
YET IT IS A MOMENT QUICKLY ENDED
IN THIS BLEAK WORLD THE FUTURE WOULD SEEM TO BELONG TO THE TYRANTS AND TERRORISTS
OVER HALF A CENTURY FEDERAL POLICY HAS SAPPED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORLD'S STRONGEST AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY
THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF U. S. FOOD EXPORTS BUT WHETHER THOSE EXPORTS ARE SOLD AT A PROFIT OR A LOSS
THE SOONER POLITICIANS STOP TRYING TO HELP FARMERS THE BETTER OFF THE MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCTIVE FARMERS WILL BE
ESPRIT IS NOW A LEANER COMPANY THAT OPERATES MORE CONVENTIONALLY
ACCORDING TO MR. FEDERICO THE OPERATIONS CHIEF EACH DIVISION NOW HAS A BUDGET TO FOLLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME

THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR <NOISE>
MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
UNTIL NOW SANCTIONS BACKERS IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE SOUTH AFRICA FOR THEIR OWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL PURPOSES WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FULL COSTS
THE SUFFERING THAT SANCTIONS HAVE INFLICTED ON BLACKS AND THE LOSS OF U. S. INFLUENCE IN THE REGION HAVE NOT IMPRESSED THEM MUCH
BUT THE NEXT ROUND WILL DO MORE SEVERE DAMAGE ON THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS THE SENATE DEBATES WHETHER TO SECOND THE SCORCHED EARTH POLICY THE HOUSE HAS ADOPTED
BROKERAGE FIRMS WHICH NEGOTIATE RATES WITH THE BANKS AND THRIFTS WHOSE C. D.S THEY SELL OFFER SOME OF THE BEST YIELDS
THE AVERAGE YIELD ON A BROKER SOLD THREE MONTH C. D. FOR EXAMPLE WAS EIGHT POINT SIX SIX PERCENT

DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS I REMAIN A REPORTER SEATED ON A CHAIR IN A BOOKSTORE
REAGAN SAID HE WOULD LIKE THE SENATE TO VOTE THIS WEEK ON BORK'S NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT

RULE TEN B. THIRTEEN SAYS ONCE A TENDER OFFER BEGINS THE BIDDER MUST TREAT ALL SHAREHOLDERS ALIKE
BUT PENNZOIL OFFERED TO PAY THE GETTY MUSEUM MORE FOR ITS SHARES SOONER THAN IT WOULD PAY OTHER SHAREHOLDERS EVEN IF THE MERGER FAILED
THE S. E. C. SAID THAT THIS PLAINLY VIOLATED RULE TEN B. THIRTEEN
<NOISE> EVEN IF THERE WAS A CONTRACT IT WAS VOID
TEXACO CAN'T BE GUILTY OF INTERFERING WITH A NONEXISTENT CONTRACT
ANALYSTS DOUBT OTHER BIDDERS WOULD BE SO BOLD
THE CHANCES OF BRITOIL ESCAPING B. P. SEEM REMOTE SAYS JEREMY ELDEN AN OIL ANALYST AT THE LONDON *STOCKBROKERAGE* PHILLIPS AND DREW
IT WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR SOMEONE TO COME IN AND TOP B. P. HE SAID
IT'S VERY DISCOURAGING SAYS MARTIN WEILD BEIJING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR U. S. CHINA TRADE
U. S. COMPANIES COULD STAND TO LOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SALES
SOME U. S. CORPORATIONS COMPLAIN THAT THE MOVE HAS EVEN CAUSED CHINESE BUYERS TO RETHINK PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS THAT AREN'T AFFECTED BY THE POLICY SHIFT
MEANWHILE THE SECURITIES FIRM PARENT COMPANY PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA REPORTED MODEST GAINS IN MOST FINANCIAL CATEGORIES

BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
HOWEVER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES
IT HAS BEEN PRESSURING GERMANY TO CUT ITS INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY IMPLICATION CREATE A BIGGER MARKET FOR U. S. EXPORTS
THIS EXPLAINS THE WAR OF WORDS OVER GERMANY'S REFUSAL TO CUT INTEREST RATES FOR MUCH OF LAST YEAR
THE DISPUTE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE PRESENT CENTER RIGHT COALITION GOVERNMENT OF CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL RECORDS ITS EXPECTED ELECTION VICTORY NEXT WEEK
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
YOU COULD PLAY A GAME ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY A(RE)- LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SOCIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
BUT MANY TIBETANS CONSIDER THE DALAI LAMA TO BE THEIR RIGHTFUL POLITICAL LEADER AS WELL SOMETHING THE CHINESE CAN'T ACCEPT
TRAVELERS KEPT TIBETANS WELL INFORMED OF THE DALAI LAMA'S RECENT VISIT TO THE U. S. AND HIS CALLS FOR TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE
WHEN THE CHINESE PRESS IN TIBET RESPONDED BY SAVAGELY ATTACKING BOTH THE PRO INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT AND THE DALAI LAMA HIMSELF THE MONKS WERE MOVED TO ACTION
AT DREPUNG THEY SET TO WORK CRAFTING TIBETAN FLAGS WHICH THEY USED IN THE INITIAL PRO INDEPENDENCE MARCH SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH

UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM SHOPS ARE ONLY SUPPOSED TO HANDLE TAPES THAT ARE PACKAGED IN THE COLOR CODED CASES
TAPES APPROVED BY ADULTS ONLY ARE IN RED CASES
TAPES THAT CAN BE WATCHED BY CHILDREN AGE THIRTEEN OR OLDER COME IN BLUE CONTAINERS
AND TAPES SUITABLE FOR ALL AGE GROUPS ARE PACKAGED IN GREEN
THE DIFFERENT COLORED CASINGS ARE MADE BY A LOCAL COMPANY
ACCORDING TO SOME PHYSICIANS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH BUSY YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
THEY REFUSE TO REST AND DEMAND TREATMENT WITH ANTIBIOTICS
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLU ANTIBIOTICS ARE USELESS
SUCH DRUGS ARE DESIGNED TO FIGHT BACTERIA NOT VIRUSES
AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISKS
THE FIRM IS A BIG GOVERNMENT BOND TRADER AND HAS GROWN A LOT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
AND AMONG MORGAN STANLEY'S BIGGEST PERCENTAGE GAINS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS EQUITY PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH NEARLY TRIPLED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE
IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE LEARNING OUR WAY WITH THE ALLANTE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
THE CAR IS DOING THE THINGS THAT WE WANT IT TO DO FOR US AS FAR AS GETTING VISIBILITY FOR THE DIVISION AND BEING AN IMAGE CAR
SINCE IT'S BEEN A NEW ENTITY FOR CADILLAC AND OUR DEALERS WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL VO- SALES VOLUMES WOULD BE
IN JULY MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS ROSE EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IN THE DOLDRUMS FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF HIGH VACANCY RATES AND CHANGES IN THE TAX LAWS
MULTIFAMILY HOUSING STARTS FELL NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT IN JUNE AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT IN MAY
THE REBOUND IN JULY REFLECTS AN EASING OF BACKLOGS IN PERMIT APPROVALS FOR THIS SECTOR MR. SHEEHAN SAID
LAST MONTH'S MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS WERE NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT BELOW THAT OF JULY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS CORN AND WHEAT PRICES WERE MOSTLY HIGHER IN A REBOUND FROM MONDAY'S SESSION WHEN CORN SET NEW LIFE OF CONTRACT LOWS
MANY TRADERS BOUGHT CONTRACTS TO COVER SHORT OR SELLING POSITIONS
ANALYSTS SAID TECHNICAL FACTORS ALSO PLAYED A PART AS PRICES BACKED AND FILLED THE GAPS LEFT ON PRICE CHARTS BY MONDAY'S STEEP DROP
MR. HENKEL A FORMER ATLANTA ATTORNEY WAS APPOINTED TO THE THREE MEMBER BANK BOARD BY PRESIDENT REAGAN NOVEMBER SEVEN
HE HAS PUT ALL HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT HAD TRANSACTIONS WITH THRIFTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH LOANS FROM LINCOLN INTO A BLIND TRUST

HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER

BUSINESS AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT GROUPS PREDICT THAT THE CAP WOULD LEAD TO ECONOMIC DISASTER
HOMEOWNER AND ENVIRONMENTALIST GROUPS APPLAUD THE PLAN AS A WAY TO CONTROL THE CITY'S GROWTH
HOUSING STARTS IN THE CITY SET A RECORD LAST YEAR AND ARE ON THE SAME PACE THIS YEAR
<NOISE> WHAT REMAINS FOR HISTORY TO JUDGE IS FIRST HOW WELL HE SUCCEEDED
HERE THE JUDGMENT MAY BE MIXED
WE DO HAVE LESS TAXES AND LESS INFLATION BUT BIGGER SPENDING AND AS MUCH GOVERNMENT AS BEFORE
HISTORY'S SECOND JUDGMENT WILL BE WHETHER HIS YEARS REPRESENT A MERE PASSING CHANGE OR WHETHER THE CHANGE WILL ENDURE
WE CANNOT SAY TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT COMES HEREAFTER AND WHAT COMES HEREAFTER WILL DECIDE MR. REAGAN'S PLACE AMONG OUR PRESIDENTS
SABOTEURS ARE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM SAYS MR. CAIRO REFERRING TO THE BEVY OF PEOPLE WHO SHIELD THE DEBTOR
AT THE OFFICE THE COLLECTOR'S NATURAL ENEMIES ARE SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS AND SECRETARIES SO MR. CAIRO ADVISES CALLING THE DEBTOR BEFORE NINE AFTER FIVE AND DURING LUNCH

MR. WASHINGTON GREW UP IN CHICAGO POLITICS
AS A TEEN AGER HE DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS FOR HIS FATHER ROY A PRECINCT WORKER ON THE SOUTH SIDE
AFTER SERVING AS AN ARMY SERGEANT ON GUAM DURING WORLD WAR TWO HE EARNED A LAW DEGREE FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
HIS MARRIAGE TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ENDED IN DIVORCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE
BUT HE ADVANCED THROUGH A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC PATRONAGE JOBS TO ELECTION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND FINALLY TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE FOURTH TO TWENTY EIGHT AND ONE FOURTH
BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
<NOISE> THE TEXSTYRENE CASE ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DREXEL AND EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY A *SUBSIDIARY* OF FIRST EXECUTIVE CORPORATION IN LOS ANGELES
DREXEL KEPT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TEXSTYRENE BONDS IT HAD BOUGHT BACK FROM ITS EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS FOR A HUNDRED AND SIX AND A HALF FOR ONLY TWO TRADING DAYS
IT THEN SOLD TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF S- TEXSTYRENE BONDS FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT TWO TO EXECUTIVE LIFE
WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
MR. BRIGHT IS A *QUINTESSENTIAL* TEXAS BUSINESSMAN WHOSE FORTUNES HAVE PLUNGED IN RECENT YEARS ALONG WITH THE STATE'S
WITH INTERESTS IN ENERGY REAL ESTATE AND BANKING MR. BRIGHT HAS HAD AN UNLUCKY HAND IN EACH OF TEXAS' MOST TROUBLED INDUSTRIES
FORBES MAGAZINE ESTIMATES THAT MR. BRIGHT'S FORTUNE HAS BEEN HALVED TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM SIX HUNDRED MILLION A FEW YEARS AGO
THE TROUBLED MAKER OF PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY DIDN'T GIVE ANY ESTIMATES OF ITS EXPECTED LOSSES AND COMPANY OFFICIALS COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SOLITEC EARNED TWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SIX CENTS A SHARE ON REVENUE OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
THE RESULTS INCLUDED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM TAX BENEFITS AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING

THE RESULTS INCLUDED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INCOME FROM TAX BENEFITS
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVED UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
IN WASHINGTON SOMEONE WHO GETS CUT OFF AT THE KNEES CAN NEVER COME BACK

E. THREE STANDS MIDWAY
TRADERS HAVE SAID THAT BOWATER BONDS WAS THE BEST RECEIVED DEAL IN THE PAST TWO SESSIONS BECAUSE OF STRONG INVESTOR DEMAND FOR EVENT RISK PROTECTION
MR. MARTENS SAID VITRO WASN'T PREPARED TO AGREE TO THAT CONDITION

IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
<NOISE> EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE MILLION DOLLARS COMES FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
<NOISE> ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
<NOISE> THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME *BENEFICIARIES* OPPOSE USER FEES
THE IMPROVED RESULTS STEM LARGELY FROM GOLD SALES AT THE COMPANY'S GOLD BAR OPERATIONS IN NEVADA WHERE PRODUCTION BEGAN IN JANUARY
WE THINK WE CAN SUSTAIN PRODUCTION OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TO FIFTY THOUSAND OUNCES ANNUALLY FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS MR. WEAVER SAID IN AN INTERVIEW

THE NEW ORLEANS COMPANY WOULDN'T IDENTIFY THE UNDERWRITERS
SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENA WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
<NOISE> NOW THE PROJECT'S FOCUS IS PERFECTING A HUMAN ENGINE AN ATHLETE WHO CAN FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY AND PEDAL LIKE A WORKER BEE
THE FLIGHT FROM CRETE WILL LAST FOUR TO SIX HOURS DEPENDING ON WINDS AND OTHER FACTORS

IF THE MODERN DAEDALUS LETS UP EVEN FOR A FEW SECONDS HE WILL PLUNGE INTO THE SEA
THE EGYPTIANS WERE UNHAPPY WITH MANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PARTICIPATION BUT NEVERTHELESS OPTED FOR THE M. ONE OVER ALTERNATIVES FROM BRITAIN FRANCE AND BRAZIL
THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THAT THEY COULD USE OUR GRANTS TO BUY IN SAID AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
IT'S NOT GOING TO COST THEM A THING
BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SAID MESSRS.
<NOISE> SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT

HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE

IT'S NOT A FLUKE
IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
BURLINGTON ALSO HAS BEEN MOVING AGGRESSIVELY IN COURT TO COUNTER THE HOSTILE BID

OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE

<NOISE> SENATOR EXON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN PROPONENTS OF BLOCKING CERTAIN FOREIGN INVESTMENT
WHEN FUJITSU ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO TAKE OVER FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION LAST YEAR HE WAS QUICK TO COMPLAIN
FAIRCHILD ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF U. S. SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION AND WAS ALREADY CONTROLLED BY SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION A LARGELY FRENCH OWNED FIRM
NEVERTHELESS SENATOR EXON SAID THAT THE MERGER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY
HE ALSO QUESTIONED WHETHER OPEC PRODUCTION IS AS HIGH AS IT IS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION AS TO WHAT THE ACTUAL LEVEL IS HE SAID
BUT HE ADDED I HOPE THAT THIS OVERPRODUCTION IS AN ABERRATION AND NOT A TREND
IN THE MILITARY OR IN ANY APPOINTED LEADERSHIP POSITION YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE JOB YOU HOLD HE SAYS
IN POLITICS WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE SEEKING A CLAIM OR APPROBATION YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHOM YOU WOULDN'T TOLERATE FOR THIRTY SECONDS

THE PENTAGON PROPOSED INCREASING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS BY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR
<NOISE> THESE PAY FOR TRAINING SHIP STEAMING HOURS AND THE COSTS OF KEEPING WEAPONS IN GOOD REPAIR
MR. CARLUCCI EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO KEEP A SMALLER FORCE THAT IS ADEQUATELY PAID AND READY TO FIGHT THAN TO HAVE A LARGER FORCE THAT ISN'T
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER IF WE REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHERE YOU KEEP THE FRAMEWORK BUT HOLLOW IT OUT HE SAID
IN AFGHANISTAN HE ADDS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
<NOISE> THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS
NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T ANYONE EITHER TO PROTECT THEM OR THREATEN THEM IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON MORALE

FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SHARES
WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
<NOISE> BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF R. I. C. O. THAN FROM REAL FELONS
THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INCORPORATED SUBSIDIARY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES
LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER
BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SPECIALTY RETAILING TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON SEARS'S BOTTOM LINE
SEARS'S MERCHANDISE GROUP ALONE GENERATED PROFIT OF SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WON'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT
HOWEVER A SEARS SPOKESWOMAN SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE ANY QUALIFICATIONS ABOUT HOW QUICKLY OR HOW MUCH SPECIALTY ACQUISITIONS WOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO EARNINGS

I KNOW OF MANY DONOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
MR. SHORTELL AND DOCTOR HUGHES SAY PATIENT CARE MAY HAVE BEEN HURT BY COST CUTTING IN SEVERAL AREAS SUCH AS HOSPITAL'S SLASHING OF NURSING STAFFS
THAT VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN NURSING ASSOCIATION WHICH BLAMES COST CONTAINMENT FOR *EXACERBATING* THE CURRENT NURSING SHORTAGE
MANY HOSPITALS CUT BACK ON NURSES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RAISE SALARIES ENOUGH TO LURE THEM BACK
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE

SINCE THE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS ARE SIMILAR IN ALL THREE TYPES ARE WE ALSO BANNED FROM PROVIDING THEM TO OUR ALLIES
CRUISES ARE ESSENTIAL OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY CAN CARRY CONVENTIONAL WARHEADS AND THUS DEFEND EUROPE WITHOUT THREATENING A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE
BUT THE U. S. GAVE UP ALL GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISES AS PART OF THE I. N. F. BECAUSE WE SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL

IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL
THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST

THE JOB WILL NOT GET DONE
BOND PRICES STILL ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT TUESDAY MORNING THAT ALAN GREENSPAN WILL REPLACE PAUL VOLCKER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD

THE COMPANY IS INCREASING ITS EMPHASIS ON TRUCKS WHERE ITS JEEPS AND MINIVANS ARE AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S STRONGEST SELLING VEHICLES
IN JUNE CHRYSLER SOLD MORE TRUCKS THAN CARS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND THAT PATTERN MAY CONTINUE
BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN THE U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
CURRENCY LOSSES COULD ALSO EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR

THE COURT BASED ITS RULING ON A SECTION OF THE LAW STATING THAT THE PROVISION WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE HIGHEST PRICE SHALL BE APPLICABLE
THE PANEL NOTED THAT SINCE MARKET PRICES WERE FAIRLY HIGH WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED THIS PROVISION SET A CEILING ABOVE WHICH REGULATED PRICES COULDN'T RISE
NOW WITH MARKET PRICES LOW IT SERVES AS A PRICE FLOOR BELOW WHICH REGULATED PRICES CAN'T DROP IT SAID

IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SAYS A KEY PLAYER IN THE BATTLE
IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY BECAUSE GENERALE DE *BELGIQUE* IS RICH NOW

ACTUALLY SOMETHING RATHER LIKE THIS DOES HAPPEN BUT ONLY AMONG CERTAIN ELITE GROUPS THAT DEBATE SUCH DETAILED ISSUES
AND THE DEPTH AND OPENNESS OF THIS DEBATE UNQUESTIONABLY IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF STRENGTH IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM
THE ELITES MOREOVER ARTICULATE CHOICES AND CALL A NATION TO ITS IDEALS
SOME OF THE MOST THOUGHTFUL STUDENTS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BELIEVE THAT THE UPBRINGING AND TRAINING OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ELITES ARE THE KEY TO THE SYSTEM'S SUCCESS
<NOISE> TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT

AND AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FIRM LAWRENCE PEDOWITZ MAINTAINS THAT GOLDMAN ITSELF WAS BLAMELESS IN MR. FREEMAN'S WRONGDOING
THE FIRM HAD STATE OF THE ART COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT MR. PEDOWITZ SAYS
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT INADEQUATE
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME THINGS NO COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT CAN PICK UP
AND THE COMMISSION IS ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THAT THE WEAKER DOLLAR DOESN'T KEEP AMERICANS AWAY
WE'RE TRYING TO URGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO STABILIZE PRICES SO THAT THEY DON'T FLUCTUATE AS MUCH AS THE DOLLAR SAYS SPOKESMAN NEIL MARTIN
EVEN SO SOME PRICES THOSE FOR MANY LUXURY HOTELS IN ITALY AND FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN SOARING
IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
<NOISE> THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORPORATION A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN JOBS
COSTS ARE ANOTHER PROBLEM
DOCTOR RESNICK SAYS ULTRASOUND SCREENINGS FOR PROSTATE CANCER CAN COST UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS COMPARED TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A TRADITIONAL PROSTATE EXAM
ALSO HE SAYS THE ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE TAKES FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES COMPARED WITH FIVE MINUTES FOR THE TRADITIONAL METHOD
ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES
MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
I'M ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
YOU CAN TOO
ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
WEST GERMANY IS PLAYING FOR THE LONG TERM SAYS PIERRE LELLOUCHE OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS
IT BELIEVES IT CAN GET EAST GERMANY BACK WITHOUT FALLING UNDER SOVIET DOMINATION ITSELF
MR. LELLOUCHE AND MOST OTHER FRENCHMEN DON'T THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE
HOW WILL THE COMPANY DEAL WITH ITS DEBT AND OPERATIONS AFTER THE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP
MR.-
STEGEMEIER IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT AFTER HE BECOMES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE COMPANY SPOKESMAN SAID
IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE LEARNING OUR WAY WITH THE ALLANTE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
THE CAR IS DOING THE THINGS THAT WE WANT IT TO DO FOR US AS FAR AS GETTING VISIBILITY FOR THE DIVISION AND BEING AN IMAGE CAR
SINCE IT'S BEEN A NEW ENTITY FOR CADILLAC AND OUR DEALERS WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL SALES VOLUME WOULD BE
AGFA GEVAERT IS A RIDGEFIELD PARK NEW JERSEY MAKER OF PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES THAT IS OWNED BY BAYER A. G. OF WEST GERMANY
AGFA GEVAERT ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK IT WOULD SEEK TO ACQUIRE THE EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF MATRIX IT DIDN'T ALREADY OWN FOR TEN DOLLARS A SHARE
MATRIX SAID AT THAT TIME THAT ITS BOARD REVIEWED THE OFFER BUT THE RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW WEREN'T ANNOUNCED
THE ADVERTISEMENT ANNOUNCING THE TENDER OFFER SAYS A MERGER AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE TWO FIRMS LAST WEEK
AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
MANY PEOPLE CRITICIZE ADS THAT GLORIFY JUNK
SOME SINGLED OUT AS CONTRADICTORY A COOKING OIL AD TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO CUT DOWN ON CHOLESTEROL BUT FEATURING FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES
IT'S ALSO DISHONEST SOME SAID TO OMIT INFORMATION OR HIDE IT IN SMALL PRINT
<NOISE> THEY NOTED THAT ADS FOR HIGH FIBER CEREALS NEGLECT TO MENTION THEIR SALT AND SUGAR CONTENT
<NOISE> THE MICRO CHANNEL IS OUR STRATEGY SAID BILL LOWE THE HEAD OF I. B. M.'S P. C. DIVISION
WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY SAYING THAT SINCE APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHEN THE P. S. TWO LINE WAS INTRODUCED
<NOISE> IF WE KEPT CHANGING DIRECTIONS I COULD SEE PEOPLE QUESTIONING THAT
WE GIVE A LOOK LIKE A GENERATION BEFORE THEM LIVED HERE SAYS MR. MARDER
THAT'S WORTH MONEY
IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE THE COMPANY HAS DOUBLED ITS PROFITS AND TRIPLED ITS STAFF HE ADDS
SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE <NOISE>
SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO BRITISH INVESTORS' REGARD FOR THESE SERVICE COMPANIES
U. S. AND BRITISH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS DIFFER FOR THE GOOD WILL ARISING FROM ACQUISITIONS YIELDING HIGHER REPORTED EARNINGS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES
SOME ANALYSTS SUGGEST U. K. INVESTORS HAVE FEW HIGH GROWTH INDUSTRIES TO CHOOSE FROM AND SO LOOK FAVORABLY ON SERVICE COMPANIES
THAT LEAVES RETAIL BROKERAGE FIRMS WITH A STARK CHOICE
THEY CAN MOVE ONTO THE INSTITUTIONAL FIRMS' TURF AND FIGHT FOR A TOP SPOT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
OR THEY CAN SETTLE ONTO THE SECOND RANK OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS PERHAPS FOREVER
ASSETS OF TWO HUNDRED GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS ROSE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SEVENTY POINT THREE SIX BILLION DOLLARS
ASSETS OF NINETY THREE BROKER DEALER FUNDS FELL THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHT POINT ZERO ONE BILLION DOLLARS
ASSETS OF ONE HUNDRED THREE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FELL FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SIXTY SIX POINT ONE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
THE RIVALS HAVE DISPUTED EACH OTHER'S CIRCULATION CLAIMS FOR YEARS
ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET
YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. NEW YORK
YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
THE PURCHASING MANAGERS SOUNDED MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN MOST ECONOMISTS IN SEVERAL RECENT SURVEYS
MANY ECONOMISTS FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S COLLAPSE ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH WILL MAKE SHOPPERS MORE CAUTIOUS ESPECIALLY ON SUCH MAJOR PURCHASES AS AUTOS AND HOMES
SOME ALSO FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S WOES MAY PERSUADE COMPANIES TO POSTPONE CAPITAL SPENDING PLANS UNTIL A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY'S HEALTH EMERGES
NEVERTHELESS MOST ECONOMISTS STILL CONTEND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A RECESSION COMING ANYTIME SOON
<NOISE> TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
TODAY'S GAMES RELY ON COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES
AS COMPUTER CHIPS HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL THE IMAGES HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND VIVID BUT STILL AREN'T REALISTIC
UNDER DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER ARE GAMES IN WHICH THE PLAYERS INTERACT WITH VIDEOTAPE SCENES
THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT
WE ARE NOT A DISTURBING FORCE IN THIS MARKET AND I DON'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN KICKING THREE JAPANESE FIRMS OUT FROM BEING PRIMARY DEALERS
WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR U. S. MARKETS AND THE U. S. ECONOMY
EQUICOR WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BY EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND TO MANAGE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS FOR CORPORATIONS
AFTER POSTING TWO YEARS OF LOSSES IT BROKE EVEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR
EXECUTIVES OF BOTH EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION SAID THEY EXPECT THE VENTURE TO BE PROFITABLE THIS YEAR
ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE
FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LENDING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
ONE STUMBLING BLOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
<NOISE> AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE -(DE)TERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
MR. DAVIDOFF COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
HIS LAWYER PAUL ROONEY SAID MR.
DAVIDOFF DEEPLY REGRETS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOESKY COMPANY'S FAILURE TO REMAIN AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S NET CAPITAL RULES
MR. ROONEY EMPHASIZED THAT MR. DAVIDOFF WASN'T CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING
WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CAPITAL RULE CARRIES A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE
STOCK EXCHANGES COMMODITY MARKETS MANY BANKS AND SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE U. S. MONDAY IN OBSERVANCE OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
FEDERAL OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY REGULAR MAIL DELIVERIES
<NOISE> MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ALSO WILL BE CLOSED
THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
PUROLATOR JUMPED FIVE AND A HALF TO FORTY AND THREE EIGHTHS
EMERY AIR FREIGHT BEGAN A FORTY DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF PUROLATOR'S COMMON
EMERY ROSE SEVEN EIGHTHS TO THIRTEEN AND ONE HALF
NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORP.
THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
MITSUBISHI HAS AN INFLUENTIAL NAME WHICH IS ONE REASON FOR THE REPUTATION DEALERS SAID
BUT IT ALSO BENEFITED FROM HAVING LAUNCHED THE BONDS JUST AHEAD OF A NUMBER OF SCHEDULED DEALS BY OTHER JAPANESE BANKS GETTING INTO THE MARKET BEFORE OVERCROWDING TAKES PLACE
BECAUSE THE BANK CONVERTIBLES GENERALLY APPEAL TO A MORE CONSERVATIVE MARKET SEGMENT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PROBLEMS OF THE EQUITY WARRANT SECTOR
TO DO THE JOB S. C. I. HAS ASSEMBLED WHAT ANALYSTS CALL A CRACK MANAGEMENT TEAM
PRESIDENT EUGENE SAPP RUNS THE COMPANY ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND HE DOES SO IN A NO FRILLS ATMOSPHERE
FOR EXAMPLE COMPANY CARS PLANES AND COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ARE TABOO
MR. PATRICK AND ANYONE ELSE GIVING THE MATTER SERIOUS THOUGHT KNOWS THAT REGULATORY BODIES CAN'T MANAGE ENTERPRISES HARD AS THEY TRY
EVEN THE APPOINTED MANAGERS OF UNREGULATED COMPANIES IN COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES HAVE A HARD TIME CONTROLLING COSTS
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO DO THE OPPOSITE
FOLLOWING THE WILSON AFFAIR THE PANEL DID CONDUCT SEVERAL STAFF INQUIRIES IN REACTION TO NEWS STORIES
ONE YIELDED REPRIMANDS OF REPS.
DANIEL CRANE REPUBLICAN ILLINOIS AND GERRY STUDDS DEMOCRAT MASSACHUSETTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE FOR SEXUAL AFFAIRS WITH HOUSE PAGES
REP. GEORGE HANSEN REPUBLICAN IDAHO DREW A REPRIMAND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AFTER A FELONY CONVICTION FOR FALSIFYING HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES
AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL
IT DECLINED TO ELABORATE
IF BLACK AND DECKER SHOULD RESUME ITS PURSUIT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE AMERICAN STANDARD SAID THE COMPANY IS PREPARED TO RESIST AGAIN
HIS INABILITY TO RECOVER FROM OCTOBER'S MARKET PLUNGE WAS TRACED TO A HOSTILE BID FROM TWO F- RIVAL FINANCIERS FOR BELL RESOURCES LIMITED WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY BELL GROUP
THE BID FORCED MR. HOLMES A COURT TO CALL OFF A PROPOSED MERGER OF THE BELL COMPANIES
THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT SAID DARRYL SMALLEY A DIRECTOR AT THE PERTH BROKERAGE HARTLEY POYNTON LIMITED
AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
THE ARMY WANTS TO STOP BUYING THE TRUCKS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO HAUL UP TO TEN TONS OF AMMUNITION MORTARS AND ROCKETS TO SOME PROSPECTIVE BATTLEFIELD
IT WANTS TO CONCENTRATE INSTEAD ON DEVELOPING A NEW SIXTEEN TON TRUCK
BUT MR. ASPIN WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
AT HIS BEHEST AND AGAINST THE PENTAGON'S WISHES CONGRESS CONTINUES TO POUR MONEY INTO THE TRUCK PROGRAM
BUT WHEN THE SUBJECT IS FARMING HE CAN'T MASK HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
I THOUGHT I'D BE IN A HECK OF A LOT BETTER POSITION BY NOW HE SAYS
BEFORE THE DROUGHT I THOUGHT WE HAD A GOOD SHOT AT A GOOD YEAR
THE PLYWOOD AND INSULATION MAKER SAID IT DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF ONE SHARE OF A NEW ISSUE OF PREFERRED STOCK FOR EACH OF ITS COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
THE RIGHTS GIVE HOLDERS THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE COMPANY SHARES AT A STEEP DISCOUNT IN VARIOUS HOSTILE TAKEOVER CIRCUMSTANCES
THE DISTRIBUTION IS PAYABLE TO HOLDERS OF RECORD SEPTEMBER NINE AND EXPIRES AUGUST THIRTY ONE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
POWER FINANCIAL IS A FINANCIAL SERVICES CONCERN THAT IS SIXTY NINE PERCENT HELD BY POWER CORP. OF CANADA A MONTREAL BASED HOLDING COMPANY
MONTREAL TRUSTCO IS THE PARENT OF MONTREAL TRUST COMPANY
A CANADIAN TRUST COMPANY IS SIMILAR TO A U. S. SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION
THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET
BULLION DEALERS SAY THE FIVE HOUSES FIXING THE GOLD PRICE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET AND REQUIREMENTS OF BRITISH FINANCIAL LEGISLATION
AS A GROUP THE FIVE BULLION FIRMS TRANSACT LESS BUSINESS THAN OUTSIDE MARKET MAKERS SEVERAL LONDON BULLION TRADERS SAY
UNLIKE GOLD FUTURES MARKETS IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO HOWEVER THE LONDON GOLD MARKET DOESN'T PUBLISH TRADING STATISTICS
MR. ICAHN COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT INTENTIONS HE MIGHT ULTIMATELY HARBOR TOWARD TENNECO
HIS POSITION IN THE COMPANY IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE ONE OF MORE THAN TWENTY SIMILAR STAKES HE HAS AMASSED IN A VARIETY OF CONCERNS
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED HE ALSO CONTROLS AN ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT STAKE IN U. S. X. CORPORATION A PITTSBURGH BASED OIL AND STEEL CONCERN
IN AMSTERDAM STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN VOLATILE TRADING
SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID
VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION *PRODUCED* WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD CAP A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE NEW HOME
IT ALSO WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR VICTORY FOR NEW YORK CITY WHICH HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP COMPANIES FROM FLEEING THE CITY
N. B. C. HAD BEEN CONSIDERING MOVING SOME OR ALL OF ITS FACILITIES TO NEW JERSEY
FRED M. GIBBONS THIRTY EIGHT RESIGNED AS SOFTWARE PUBLISHING'S CHAIRMAN AND SUCCEEDS MS. BEDKE AS PRESIDENT
HE ALSO WAS NAMED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER A POST WHICH WASN'T FILLED WHEN MR. GIBBONS STEPPED DOWN FROM BOTH POSITIONS IN AUGUST
SINCE THEN THE TWO EXECUTIVES HAD BEEN SHARING DAY TO DAY OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT MR. GIBBONS SAID
MR. MCMILLIN SAID THE TWO RETAILING UNITS COULD FETCH BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
BUT SPECULATION IN RETAILING CIRCLES PUT THE POTENTIAL PRICE TAG AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
IT'S THE WORST TIME TO SELL A RETAILER SAID ONE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
THEY MISSED THE HIGH IN AUGUST WHEN PUBLICLY TRADED SPECIALTY RETAILERS WERE SELLING AT MULTIPLES AS HIGH AS THIRTY FIVE TIMES EARNINGS
NOW THEY'RE TRADING AT TEN TO TWELVE TIMES EARNINGS
AND ACCORDING TO TEXACO IT COULD ALL ADD UP TO SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS BY MR. ICAHN
TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE IN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH A SERIOUS PARTNER IF YOU'RE NOT IS A SERIOUS VIOLATION MR. *BOIES* SAID
MR. ICAHN HOWEVER TICKED OFF NUMEROUS DETAILS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE THIRD PARTIES
THESE DETAILS HE SAID WERE INDICATIONS THAT TALKS WERE SERIOUS AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED
UNCONVINCED THE HARRISBURG CITY COUNCIL IN APRIL PASSED AN ORDINANCE REQUIRING LOCAL EMPLOYERS WITH TEN OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO GIVE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE
HARRISBURG IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST U. S. CITY TO PASS SUCH A STATUTE AND IT IS MUCH STRICTER THAN ANY STATE LEGISLATION
FOR INSTANCE WISCONSIN PASSED A PARENTAL LEAVE LAW IN APRIL WHICH PROVIDES ONLY SIX WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE AND EXEMPTS COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES
MERITOR ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
ITS DEPOSITS ARE STILL INSURED BY FEDERAL *DEPOSIT* INSURANCE CORP.
HELPED BY WEDNESDAY'S WALL STREET RALLY AND IMPROVED COMMODITY PRICES STOCK PRICES POSTED ROBUST GAINS IN SYDNEY
TURNOVER REMAINED THIN
AN EARLY SPURT OF DOMESTIC LED DEMAND DROVE PRICES TO THEIR BEST LEVELS DURING THE FIRST HOUR OF ACTIVITY
THEY DRIFTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SESSION AND CLOSED JUST SHORT OF THEIR PEAKS
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAID THE MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
IN HOUSTON A COASTAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER
WE ANTICIPATE ASKING FOR A REHEARING OR APPEALING TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SPOKESMAN SAID
HE ADDED WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THE REVERSAL
WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID CASE
MR. REGAN ASKED YESTERDAY WHETHER HE PLANS TO RESIGN TOLD REPORTERS NO ABSOLUTELY NOT
THE FORMER MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY CHAIRMAN ADDED FURTHER THAT IF I'M INEFFECTIVE OR NOT HELPING THIS PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY I WOULD RESIGN
BUT IN THIS CASE I DON'T FEEL I HAVE ANY *PARTICULAR* CULPABILITY
FOUR OTHER COMPANIES ARE VYING TO SHARE THE BOOSTER ROCKET BUSINESS WITH MORTON HERCULES INC. AEROJET GENERAL CORP. UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP. AND ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.
A HERCULES REPRESENTATIVE CONTENDED AT THE HEARING THAT THE COMPETITION COULD LOWER THE COST OF THE BOOSTER ROCKET AS MUCH AS ONE THIRD
AN OFFICIAL OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES' CHEMICAL SYSTEMS DIVISION SAID THE COMPANY HAS STUDIED WAYS OF TERMINATING THE BOOSTER ROCKETS IN THE EVENT OF A MALFUNCTION
BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
TEXAS STARTED EVALUATING POTENTIAL S. S. C. SITES ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW HAS SOLID DATA ON SIX LOCATIONS SAYS DILLARD HAMMETT STATE ENERGY ADVISER
FOUR MORE COMMUNITIES HAVE SINCE ASKED TO BE INCLUDED
CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FLAT RELATIVELY EARTHQUAKE FREE LANDSCAPE MR. HAMMETT SAYS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TEXAS COULD HAVE THE SITE
THE WINNERS THE AMERICANS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A TIME OF FIVE MINUTES FOUR SECONDS
CANADA CLOCKED IN AT FIVE MINUTES THIRTY FIVE SECONDS
IN THE GLORY OF THE MOMENT THE DETROIT POLICEMEN HUGGED ONE ANOTHER AND SHOUTED WE'RE NUMBER ONE
DURABLE GOODS ORDERS ROSE ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT IN JUNE BUT THE GAIN CAME ENTIRELY FROM MILITARY ITEMS
THE REPORT WAS CONSIDERED A FURTHER SIGN THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK
BUT ANALYSTS SAY MANUFACTURING IS IMPROVING
ANOTHER BAROMETER OF THE ECONOMY'S FUTURE COURSE CALLED THE LONG LEADING COMPOSITE IS COMPILED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CYCLE RESEARCH
THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE HAS SIGNALED RECESSIONS ON THE AVERAGE BY FOURTEEN MONTHS A SOMEWHAT LONGER LEAD TIME THAN FOR THE COMMERCE INDEX
IT IS OF NO SURPRISE ACCORDINGLY THAT THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE REACHED A PEAK BEFORE THE COMMERCE INDEX IN JULY
SINCE THEN THE COMPOSITE HAS FALLEN WITH LITTLE INTERRUPTION
WITHOUT SUCH DECISIVE ACTION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO THOSE WHO HAD PROPERLY HEDGED THEIR PORTFOLIOS WOULD HAVE BEEN BROKEN
UNLIKE THE OLD DAYS THE ENSUING SCRAMBLE FOR CASH WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON SECURITIES FIRMS RATHER THAN THE BANKING SYSTEM
THE FED PROPERLY SHIFTED ITS EMPHASIS TO AVERT A BREAKDOWN IN THE PAYMENTS SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS
THE COMPANY SAID LIFE INSURANCE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS HAD RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
IT SAID THAT FINANCE UNIT EARNINGS ROSE FORTY ONE PERCENT AND THAT ITS LEASING UNIT HAD RECORD RESULTS BECAUSE OF HIGH UTILIZATION RATES
CONSUMER LENDING ALONG WITH TAX AND TITLE OPERATIONS DECLINED REFLECTING LAGGING BUT NOW IMPROVING REAL ESTATE SALES THE COMPANY SAID
ANALYSTS SAY THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE THAT KAO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLIER U. S. ACQUISITION
LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORP. FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
HIGH POINT PRODUCES RAW MATERIALS FOR TOILETRIES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
KODAK MAKES A BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY MOSTLY FOR ITSELF
IT SELLS ABOUT TWO MILLION POUNDS TO SIX U. S. DISTRIBUTORS WHO RESELL TO OTHERS
KODAK KNOWS THE IDENTITY OF THE END USERS OF ONE MILLION POUNDS BUT CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE REST
HOECHST *CELANESE* SELLS ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TO DOZENS OF DISTRIBUTORS A SPOKESMAN SAYS
IN SOME INSTANCES WE KNOW WHO THE DISTRIBUTOR SELLS TO THE SPOKESMAN SAYS
IN SOME CASES WE DON'T
BUSH SAID HIS SEARCH FOR A RUNNING MATE IS PROCEEDING IN AN ORDERLY FASHION
SOURCES SAID THAT SENATE G. O. P. LEADER DOLE HAD BEEN NOTIFIED BY BUSH THAT HE WAS AMONG ABOUT A DOZEN VICE PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS
BUSH WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IS ASSURED SAID HE WON'T DISCLOSE HIS CHOICE UNTIL NEXT MONTH'S PARTY CONVENTION
U. S. SHOE CORP. SAID IT ACQUIRED TWENTY NINE SHOE STORES FROM ARIZONA SHOE CORP.
THE STORES ARE IN DENVER AND PHOENIX AND TUCSON ARIZONA
TERMS WEREN'T DISCLOSED
SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED
WITNESS THE RECENT DISPUTE OVER CONTINUING N. I. H.'S ARTIFICIAL HEART PROGRAM
BUT THE LAWMAKERS ACTUALLY SPENT ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LEGISLATION THIS *FISCAL* YEAR
AND SO FAR HARDLY ANY OF THE PROMISED ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING
WE LOST OUR BILL CONCEDES SENATOR MOYNIHAN A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT
A SMALLER MARKET SHARE STILL MEANS SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH WHEN THE ASSET POOL IS VASTLY EXPANDED NOTES GEORGE COLLINS PRESIDENT OF T. ROWE PRICE
NONETHELESS THE FIRM HAS BEEN PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE CONSUMER ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS
RETAIL CLIENTS CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT T. ROWE PRICE
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT RETAIL BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FIRM'S ASSETS
FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE GOLDMAN SACHS PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS REPUTATION AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S MOST ELITE FIRMS
GOLDMAN PARTNERS ROUTINELY HAVE EMPHASIZED THEIR TEAMWORK APPROACH TO INVESTMENT BANKING AND INSISTED THAT THEY HAD HIGHER ETHICAL STANDARDS THAN COMPETITORS'
FOR EXAMPLE GOLDMAN PROUDLY PROCLAIMED THAT ITS INVESTMENT BANKERS WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TAKE PHONE CALLS FROM ARBITRAGERS AND THAT THE FIRM RARELY ADVISED FIRMS PLANNING HOSTILE TAKEOVERS
THE F. S. L. I. C. FUND IS SUPPOSED TO COVER INSURED DEPOSITS OF EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NATION'S THREE THOUSAND FEDERALLY INSURED THRIFTS
EVEN THE BANK BOARD'S STATED ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES IS THE LOWEST RATIO OF RESERVES TO DEPOSITS EVER
ALSO PENDING ARE REQUESTS FOR MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS TO TROUBLED THRIFTS
THE ONLY THING IN HER NEW LIFE THAT MAKES MRS. BOTTEL FROWN IS THAT SHE NO LONGER GETS TO CHOOSE THE LETTERS SHE ANSWERS
EACH MONTH THE YOMIURI SENDS HER A BATCH CAREFULLY TRANSLATED AND TYPED IN ENGLISH
IN A CHEERY ROOM OF HER SUBURBAN RANCH STYLE HOUSE MRS. BOTTEL WRITES HER REPLIES THEN SENDS THEM TO TOKYO WHERE THEY ARE TRANSLATED INTO JAPANESE
STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES
L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
MITSUI AND COMPANY HAS A MINORITY STAKE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT FUND THAT ACQUIRED CONTROL OF JOSEPH HORNE COMPANY IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
A CHART IN AN EARLIER EDITION INCORRECTLY LISTED MITSUI ITS ROLE AND THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION
IN ADDITION THE CHART OMITTED SEVERAL LARGE RECENT JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS BECAUSE OF A PRODUCTION ERROR
LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN AND BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORP. AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
UNCONVINCED THE HARRISBURG CITY COUNCIL IN APRIL PASSED AN ORDINANCE REQUIRING LOCAL EMPLOYERS WITH TEN OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO GIVE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE
HARRISBURG IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST U. S. CITY TO PASS SUCH A STATUTE AND IT IS MUCH STRICTER THAN ANY STATE LEGISLATION
FOR INSTANCE WISCONSIN PASSED A PARENTAL LEAVE LAW IN APRIL WHICH PROVIDES FOR ONLY SIX WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE AND EXEMPTS COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES
GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEMOANS THE DETERIORATING QUALITY OF U. S. EDUCATION STATES SUCH AS SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN ACTING TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUND
NEW JERSEY FOR INSTANCE HAS LAUNCHED ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION FOR TEACHERS OPENING UP THE FIELD TO MANY TALENTED PEOPLE WITH NO FORMAL EDUCATION TRAINING
MINNESOTA ALLOWS STUDENTS TO ATTEND ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE STATE THAT WILL HAVE THEM TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM SCHOOLS THAT LOSE KIDS
MASSACHUSETTS IS PILOTING A SCHOOL BASED MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT TAKES POWER AWAY FROM CENTRAL DISTRICT OFFICES AND GIVES TEACHERS MORE AUTHORITY IN STAFFING AND INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS
THE SEEDS OF NATWEST'S INVESTMENT BANKING PROBLEMS WERE SOWN MONTHS BEFORE THE DEREGULATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
RIVALS SUCH AS BARCLAYS AND S. G. WARBURG GROUP P. L. C. ASSEMBLED POWERHOUSE CONGLOMERATES OF BROKERAGE TRADING AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES FIRMS
BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
AS A RESULT IT CAN MAKE SALES IN KEEPING WITH MARKET CONDITIONS WITHOUT HAVING A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ITS ECONOMY MR. NICHOLS SAID
LAST YEAR IT'S ESTIMATED THE SOVIET UNION MADE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM SALES OF PALLADIUM
IT MADE BILLIONS ON GOLD
THE U. S. WOULDN'T BE SORRY TO SEE THE SOVIET PEACE OFFENSIVE FALTER
SOME THINK THE RUSSIANS HOPE THEIR EFFORT WILL FOMENT DISCORD IN PAKISTAN WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES MAY USE IT TO OPPOSE GOVERNMENT POLICY OF HARBORING AFGHAN GUERRILLAS
MEANWHILE THE WAR CONTINUES TO DAMAGE THE SOVIETS' THIRD WORLD RELATIONS WHILE DRAINING THEIR ECONOMY AND MILITARY
WITH THE SPEAKER BEHIND IT GEPHARDT WILL PASS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR SAID REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PEASE DEMOCRAT OHIO
ADDED REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DONNELLY DEMOCRAT MASSACHUSETTS ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE
HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY UNLESS HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A PROVISION LIKE GEPHARDT
ALTHOUGH SOME CABINET MINISTERS HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN THE MASS ACTION TOOK MANY BY SURPRISE
MR. BENIGNO SAID TALK OF RESIGNING STARTED DURING A CABINET MEETING

TAX TALK BY JAMES BAKER AND HOWARD BAKER RILES ADMINISTRATION CONSERVATIVES
IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS OFF ON SIGNIFICANT TAXES THERE'LL BE A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING SAYS A WHITE HOUSE AIDE
BUT DESPITE THE RHETORIC ANY TAX BILL ACCEPTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO DO LITTLE TO REDUCE THE RED INK
SEVERE NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE ON TAKEOVERS ALSO APPEAR DOOMED

OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
BUT MR. CONABLE'S OWN NATURE STILL ISN'T CLEAR REPRESENTATIVE LAFALCE ARGUES
BARBER CONABLE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON HE SAYS
HE HAD A STRONG IDENTITY HERE IN CONGRESS WHICH HE EARNED
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN IDENTITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
HE WAS CREATED BY JIM BAKER AND GEORGE BUSH IN THIS JOB
HIS REPUTATION NOW RESTS ON HOW HE DEFINES HIMSELF
PATTEN RETAINS LAND SPECIALISTS WHO KNOW THE REGULATORY ROPES AND HOW TO GET SUBDIVISIONS APPROVED
IN AT LEAST TWO INSTANCES PATTEN SPECIALISTS HAVE BEEN ON TOWN PLANNING BOARDS WHERE PATTEN HAD PROJECTS PENDING THOUGH THEY ABSTAINED FROM VOTING
IN MAINE A KEY SPOKESMAN IS A FORMER STATE LEGISLATOR
I'M ALWAYS MAKING UP STORIES FOR THE KIDS AND ONE OF THEM WAS ABOUT A LITTLE DINOSAUR
PRETTY SOON THAT WAS THE ONLY STORY THEY WANTED TO HEAR HE SAYS
MY WIFE JODI GOT THE IDEA OF GIVING THE CHARACTER A NAME AND PUTTING HIM IN A BOOK
WE PICKED THE NAME DARBY FROM DEAN DARBY SOMEONE WE KNEW IN COLLEGE
HE'S A BIG POT BELLIED SKINNY LEGGED GUY AND IT KINDA FIT
THE GANGS ARE EVEN BECOMING ADEPT AT THEIR OWN SORT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS
THEY BUY FOOD FOR THE ELDERLY AND SNEAKERS FOR KIDS MAKING WARY ALLIES OF BOTH
THEY SPONSOR PICNICS WHERE THEY PUT UP HUGE BANNERS FLAUNTING THEIR NAMES AND COLORS
I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
THIS IS THE POOREST LAND IN THE WEST BESET BY CORRUPTION ILLITERACY DISEASE AND A HISTORY OF GOVERNMENTS THAT SEEMINGLY HAVE MADE THOSE CONDITIONS POLICY GOALS
HAITI'S PROBLEMS AND PECULIARITIES NOW SEEM SO TOWERING THAT THE LATEST POLITICAL TWISTS PROBABLY WON'T MEAN MUCH
WESTERN NOTIONS OF PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT FADE IN THE SMOKE OF A VOODOO PRIEST'S FLAMING MAGIC STONES
NOT MR. WALTER
HE SPREADS THE GOSPEL OF COMPUTER LITERACY AND TRIES TO TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY OUT OF COMPUTERS AND PUT SOME OF THE FUN BACK IN
MR. WALTER BRINGS RELIGIOUS LIKE FERVOR TO THE DIGITAL WORLD
YOU HAVE NUNS AND PRIESTS WHO DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY
I'M UNIQUE ONLY IN RELATION TO THE COMPUTER FIELD HE SAYS
MR. UNGER SAYS HE WOULDN'T POKE FUN AT NEW JERSEY IF HE DIDN'T HAVE SUCH DEEP FEELINGS ABOUT THE STATE
IT'S LIKE YOUR FIRST LOVE HE SAYS
YOU ARE HEAD OVER HEELS BUT WANT TO REMAKE HER EVEN BETTER
NEW JERSEY HE ADDS HAS IT ALL THE SHORE MOUNTAINS SKIING YOU NAME IT
IN FRANKFURT PRICES CLOSED MIXED TO HIGHER IN LIVELY TRADING
STOCKS OPENED MUCH FIRMER BUT WERE BROUGHT LOWER BY A WAVE OF PROFIT TAKING
ELECTRONICS COMPANIES SIEMENS NIXDORF AND A. E. G. ALL CLOSED HIGHER
AUTO MAKERS WERE MIXED WITH DAIMLER BENZ CLOSING SLIGHTLY DOWN BUT VOLKSWAGEN B. M. W. AND PORSCHE RISING
THE FED MAY HAVE EXPECTED US TO DROP THE PLAN GIVEN ITS CONDITIONS SAYS MR. KOMATSU
BUT AT THE END OF THAT LONG DAY HE AND SUMITOMO'S CHAIRMAN ICHIRO ISODA DECIDED TO BET THAT THE TERMS WOULD EVENTUALLY BE RELAXED
THE GLASS STEAGALL ACT SEPARATING COMMERCIAL FROM INVESTMENT BANKING IN THE U. S. GRADUALLY WILL CHANGE OR BE DONE AWAY WITH SAYS MR. KOMATSU
WE FELT THE FUTURE WOULD CERTAINLY BE BRIGHT
DREXEL'S MR. JOSEPH CALLS STALEY'S ALLEGATIONS OUTRAGEOUS
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOME OF THE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO MR. DAHL WERE MADE BUT SAYS THAT OTHERS WEREN'T
HE SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE DREXEL CUSTOMERS' HOLDINGS IN STALEY WERE EVER LARGE ENOUGH TO REQUIRE A THIRTEEN D. FILING
WHEN STOCKS ARE RISING PORTFOLIO INSURERS DON'T HEDGE AND INSTEAD RIDE THE MARKET HIGHER
WHEN STOCKS ARE FALLING PORTFOLIO INSURERS SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES IN EFFECT CUSHIONING THE VALUES OF THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS FROM THE FULL BRUNT OF A DROPPING MARKET
THE IDEA ACCORDING TO WALL STREET PROPONENTS IS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AT A LOW COST

THE BONDS ARE NONCALLABLE
BONDHOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE TO PUT THE BONDS BACK TO THE COMPANY AT PAR
THE ISSUE WAS PRICED ONE HUNDRED BASIS POINTS ABOVE THE RATE OF THE TREASURY'S FIVE YEAR NOTE
SUBSEQUENT GOVERNMENT REPORTS HOWEVER SHOW THAT EMPLOYMENT GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY STRONG IN THE FIRST QUARTER
MOREOVER THE FOURTH QUARTER BUILD UP IN BUSINESS INVENTORIES HAS BEEN REVISED DOWN SOMEWHAT BY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
AS A RESULT THE CENTRAL BANK APPARENTLY IS REVERSING ITS JANUARY MOVE
THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO START SHIPPING THE MACHINE THIS MONTH
BUT DON'T TOSS ALL YOUR PADS OF PAPER INTO THE GARBAGE YET
THE MACHINE HAS SOME LIMITATIONS
YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE STYLUS BETWEEN CHARACTERS
THE MACHINE ALSO CONVERTS HANDWRITING AT THE SLUGGISH PACE OF TWO SYMBOLS PER SECOND
AND AT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED TO THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WILL COST MORE THAN MOST CONVENTIONAL PORTABLE P. C.S
THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
MR. BUSH'S SOLUTION TO RAMPANT CRIME IS APPARENTLY TO LOCK UP MORE AMERICANS AND KEEP THEM THERE
THE U. S. ALREADY VIES WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND SOUTH AFRICA FOR THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION IN THE WORLD
DURING THE PAST DECADE THE RATE HAS DOUBLED
ON AN AVERAGE DAY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE IN PRISON OR JAIL
THAT IS ABOUT THREE OUT OF EVERY THOUSAND AMERICANS IN THE CASE OF BLACK MALES TWO OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED
IF THE TREND WERE TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA ALONE WOULD SOON INCARCERATE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
I WANTED TO RUN MY AMATEUR THEATER LIKE THE BIG TIME HE REMEMBERS
IT GAVE ME THE FEELING I WAS PART OF A LARGE INDUSTRY
I NEVER WANTED TO GO THE INDEPENDENT CIRCUIT AND RAISE MONEY FROM OIL MEN AND DOCTORS
I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK ON THE INSIDE IN
IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT ONE EIGHT TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE OH FIVE POINT EIGHTY FIVE

<NOISE> DOCTOR BRUNDTLAND THINKS THE NORWEGIAN REVOLUTION IS APPARENT IN HER OWN FAMILY
HER HUSBAND AN EDITOR AND OCCASIONAL NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST BASED AT THE NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL AFFAIRS IS A CONSERVATIVE
INDIRECTLY AT LEAST WHAT HE WRITES IS OFTEN CRITICAL OF HER POLICIES A SITUATION THAT VISITING JOURNALISTS INVARIABLY ASK HER ABOUT
HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CHINA HAD DECIDED TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES WITH THE U. S. AND JAPAN
BUT NO MIRACLE IS GOING TO APPEAR
<NOISE> ISN'T THIS OBVIOUS
A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
<NOISE> MR. ADELMAN SAYS THAT CLEARLY SERVES MOSCOW
ARMS CONTROL SERVES THE SOVIETS MORE THAN IT SERVES US BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORAL EQUIVALENTS HE SAYS
JUST THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE THEY CAN GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY FAVOR PEACE
HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
THE DEPRESSION WASN'T JUST ONE LONG SLUMP AS THE POPULAR IMAGE HAS IT BUT A SERIES OF RECOVERIES ABORTED BY FURTHER RECESSIONS
THESE SLUMPS WITHIN THE SLUMP IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WERE BOTH PRECEDED BY LARGE INCOME TAX INCREASES

MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY CONFIRMED THAT BRITISH SECURITY FORCES KILLED THREE UNARMED IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY GUERRILLAS SUNDAY IN GIBRALTAR
SIR GEOFFREY HOWE SAID A TERRORIST ACT HAS BEEN AVERTED
THE THREE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN REPORTEDLY WERE PLANNING A BOMB ATTACK ON A MILITARY PARADE TODAY IN THE BRITISH COLONY
<NOISE> THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
I KNOW BUT IT'S CLOSE
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
BEING A LIBERAL IS NOT LIKE BEING A DEMOCRAT
BEING A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN IS LIKE HAVING THE RED PIECES OR THE BLACK PIECES IN A CHECKERS GAME
<NOISE> IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORAL IMPLICATIONS
BUT BEING A LIBERAL IS BA:D
YOU CAN BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT IF YOU'RE NOT LIBERAL AND YOU CAN BE A BAD REPUBLICAN IF YOU ARE LIBERAL
AD AGENCIES IN THE PAST HAVE TYPICALLY RECEIVED AS COMMISSIONS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF AN ADVERTISER'S BILLINGS THE TOTAL COST OF PLACING ADS

PACIFIC POWER AND LIGHT IS THE PRINCIPAL UNIT OF PORTLAND OREGON BASED PACIFICORP
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE UTILITY UNIT SAID IN OUR MINDS THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF PREFERENCE WAS LAID TO REST BY THE COURT'S DECISION
THE COMPANY SAID IT EXPECTS TO PREVAIL WHEN THE COMMISSION WEIGHS THE OTHER SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS
THIS IS A VICTORY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ASSERTED THE SPOKESMAN ADDING THAT THE DAM PROVIDES OUR LOWEST COST SOURCE OF POWER
HIS LONG RELUCTANCE TO STIMULATE THE WEST GERMAN ECONOMY HAS EXASPERATED OTHER WESTERN LEADERS
AT HOME HIS DETERMINATION TO PUSH THROUGH A TAX ON INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS HAS NETTLED BUSINESSMEN
IN ADDITION HE HAS SUFFERED CRITICISM OF HIS HANDLING OF AN ELECTION SCANDAL IN HIS HOME PROVINCE OF SCHLESWIG HOLSTEIN
CONSIDER UNITED AIRLINES ONE OF THE I. B. M. NINETY THREE SEVENTY'S FIRST CUSTOMERS
IT BOUGHT THE MACHINE FOR A NEW SYSTEM TO LINK ITS RESERVATIONS COMPUTER WITH TRAVEL AGENTS
BUT THE SYSTEM UNITED UNVEILED THIS MONTH HAD I. B. M. PERSONAL COMPUTERS DOING SOME TASKS ORIGINALLY EARMARKED FOR THE NINETY THREE SEVENTY
UNITED SAYS IT HAS BEEN BUYING NINETY THREE SEVENTIES MORE SLOWLY THAN IT ORIGINALLY PLANNED
THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
<NOISE> IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A DIVE ON THIS ONE HE SAYS
I'M A LITTLE SCARED
I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
MR. DUKAKIS IS IN FACT A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN
HIS FATHER PANOS ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN TWELVE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
HIS MOTHER ARRIVED A YEAR LATER WHEN SHE WAS NINE
HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
<NOISE> FOR EXAMPLE THREE YEAR TREASURY NOTES AS OF LATE YESTERDAY YIELDED ABOUT EIGHT POINT SIX NINE PERCENT
THAT'S LESS THAN A THIRD OF A PERCENTAGE POINT BELOW THE APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT YIELD AVAILABLE ON THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BONDS
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO INVESTORS TO REACH OUT AND BUY LONG TERM TREASURYS AT NINE PERCENT MR. FROEHLICH SAID
ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
THE AUTO MAKER SAID THE WAGON VERSION OF THE MEDALLION WILL HAVE A BASE PRICE OF TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE
THE L. X. VERSION OF THE SEDAN WILL START AT TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE
THE MEDALLION BUILT IN FRANCE IS A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE CAR WITH AN ALUMINUM ENGINE
EXCO A UNIT OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS P. L. C. IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BROKERS OF INTERBANK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSITS
UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK CO. WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT HOLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
REAGAN SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON FROM INSIDE WASHINGTON POLITICS
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS CAME A DAY AFTER HE CONCEDED THAT HIS IRAN POLICY WAS A MISTAKE
THE WHITE HOUSE MEANWHILE SOUGHT TO REGAIN POLITICAL MOMENTUM AND BEGAN WEIGHING SUCH IDEAS AS A BUDGET SUMMIT AND A REAGAN SPEAKING TOUR
A FACTORY WORKER LOUNGES IN A STEAMING HOT TUB INSTALLED IN THE BACK OF A CAR
<NOISE> ANOTHER MAN DISPLAYS MUSICAL BATH SLIPPERS
<NOISE> A CROWD GATHERS AROUND AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER WHO IS MAKING A FIG TREE DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF KAREN CARPENTER
THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
HERE ARE THE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT
PREVIOUSLY THE RIGHTS OR POISON PILL WERE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY ONLY IF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STOCK WERE IN HOSTILE HANDS
THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT TO PRESCRIBE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LAW WHEN A GOOD OR SERVICE IS INVOLVED
LAWS AGAINST FRAUD SHOULD BE NO LESS APPLICABLE TO PLANT CLOSINGS OR MASS LAYOFFS
IN SHORT GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEEK TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS LIVE UP TO THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND SHOULD PROVIDE FOR LEGAL REMEDIES WHEN THEY DO NOT
BUT SUPPORTERS OF TARGETED MAIL SOLICITATION SAY THAT EVEN IF SOME LETTERS ARE IN BAD TASTE AT LEAST THEY ARE FROM LAWYERS SEEKING TO WORK ON THE VICTIMS' BEHALF
VICTIMS ARE BARRAGED WITH COME ON LET'S SETTLE SOLICITATIONS FROM INSURANCE COMPANY AND AIRLINE LAWYERS RIGHT AFTER THE CRASH SAYS MR. SHAPERO
THAT'S EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THOSE LAWYERS AREN'T EVEN ON THE VICTIM'S SIDE
MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION ARE TO BE SCRUTINIZED CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY
<NOISE> THOSE INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS AREN'T LIKELY TO WIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
CHINA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPROVE MOST INVESTMENTS IN EXPORT RELATED INDUSTRIES AND IN PROJECTS COVERING ENERGY TRANSPORT COMMUNICATIONS RAW MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS
SUEZ WHICH HAD TO RAISE ITS CAPITAL SEVERAL TIMES LAST YEAR THROUGH RIGHTS ISSUES TO FUND ITS BELGIAN BATTLE SAYS IT CAN FUND ITS ACQUISITION OF C.
INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD OR THROUGH LONG TERM LOANS
ONE SOURCE SAYS SUEZ IF VICTORIOUS WOULD LIKELY RESELL PART OF ITS STAKE IN C.
INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF C.
INDUSTRIELLE ASSETS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND MINORITY INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TWO BILLION FRANCS
<NOISE> THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON A SEVEN SEVEN VOTE LAST MONTH EFFECTIVELY KILLED MR. LUCAS'S NOMINATION TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION
A MAJORITY WAS NEEDED TO SEND THE NOMINATION TO THE FULL SENATE
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT BUSH AND MR. THORNBURGH FOR NOMINATING MR. LUCAS WHO HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS A LAWYER AND NONE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATOR
COMPANIES LISTED BELOW REPORTED QUARTERLY PROFIT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE AVERAGE OF ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES
THE COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST THREE ANALYSTS AND HAD A MINIMUM FIVE CENT CHANGE IN ACTUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE
ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL RESULTS INVOLVING LOSSES ARE OMITTED
GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS
MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING A TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
AND YET THIS HAPLESS FELLOW HAD THE GUTS TO SUE HIS FATHER AND THE AMBITION TO GRAB FOR CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION THAT BEARS HIS NAME
HE IS MOST ELUSIVE
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HE TOURED NEW YORK'S TAKEOVER HOUSES BLITHELY CHATTING ABOUT GETTY'S PROBLEMS
WAS HE NAIVELY SEEKING ADVICE OR WAS HE SUBTLY SHOWING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO OUTSIDE THE FIRM FOR ALLIES TO OUST THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT
TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
MR. TRUMP WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE DISPUTED HIS CLAIM THAT HE HOLDS THAT LARGE A GOLDEN NUGGET STAKE AS WELL AS ANY TAKEOVER THREAT
STEPHEN A. WYNN GOLDEN NUGGET'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF *EXECUTIVE* OFFICER HAS DENIED THAT THE BUY BACK IS DEFENSIVE
HE WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
CERTAINLY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED TELEVISION HAS HAD A ROLE IN THAT TRANSFORMATION
MR. ROH'S STRATEGIES SAY KOREANS HAVE TEN TIMES MORE TELEVISION SETS SOME TEN MILLION THAN IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
THUS A RECENT KIM YOUNG SAM RALLY THAT ATTRACTED A CROWD OF ONE MILLION AT HIS HOME TOWN OF PUSAN WAS A SECONDARY NEWS ITEM ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS
SEVERAL SMALLER PARTY MEETINGS ATTENDED BY MR. ROH LED THE BROADCAST
ROBERTSON REMAINS THE BIGGEST THREAT ON THE RIGHT AS KEMP STRUGGLES TO SURVIVE
THE RELIGIOUS BROADCASTER HOPES FOR A SURPRISE SHOWING IN ONE OF BUSH'S HOME STATES MAINE
BUT IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE FAILS TO WIN THE BACKING OF FUNDAMENTALISTS SURROUNDING BOB JONES UNIVERSITY THEY LOOK ASKANCE AT CHARISMATIC <NOISE> PRACTICES SUCH AS SPEAKING IN TONGUES
I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTIONS COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
NAVY WARSHIPS AND AIRCRAFT SEARCHED FOR A MISSING U. S. HELICOPTER IN THE SOUTHERN PERSIAN GULF AS IRAN ATTACKED TWO COMMERCIAL VESSELS
THE GUNSHIP CARRYING TWO CREW MEMBERS FAILED TO RETURN TO A CRUISER FOLLOWING MONDAY'S RAIDS ON IRANIAN OIL PLATFORMS AND VESSELS
THE PENTAGON ALSO SAID SEVERAL MINES WERE FOUND IN THE AREA
THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
FED OFFICIALS ARE PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE DOLLAR'S NEW FOUND STRENGTH
THEY SEE IT AS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR CONDUCT OF MONETARY POLICY IT REDUCES THE THREAT OF INFLATION AND EASES PRESSURE FOR FURTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASES
ECONOMIST DAVID HALE SAYS THE DOLLAR'S STRENGTH IS DIMMING THE PROSPECT OF AN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION AS WELL AS AN EIGHTY EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
THE DAX INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT FOUR NINE TO TWELVE EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO
AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE MONTH LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE ZERO YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
BANKS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES EXCLUDED FROM THE PRIVATE TALKS
STEPHEN D. SUSMAN ONE OF THE HUNTS' LEAD ATTORNEYS SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL HE STARTED HEARING THE OTHER BANKS' OBJECTIONS
BUT MR. SUSMAN SAID HE ISN'T TROUBLED BY THE MEETINGS
IT SEEMS LIKE GOOD SENSE TO ME
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN LITIGATION OUGHT TO BE TALKING TO PEOPLE TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT HE SAID
THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL
AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CONTRAS
WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER MEDIUM AND LONG TERM FINANCING SAYS MR. BLAKELY
IN FACT WE JUST REVIEWED THIS SUBJECT AND DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR
STILL HE ADDS I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR HIGHER RATES IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER
AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM
THE SKY ISN'T FALLING SAYS ROBERT GERARD THE HEAD OF MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INCORPORATED'S MUNICIPAL FINANCE DIVISION
SECURITIES UNDERWRITING ISN'T THE ANSWER FOR ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL LOANS
THE JOURNAL'S CLIFFORD KRAUSS LAST MONTH DESCRIBED THE DEEP ANTIPATHY AMONG THE LOCAL POPULATION TOWARDS THE POLICIES AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES OF THE SANDINISTAS' INTERNAL TRADE MINISTRY
IN THE AMERICAS COLUMN PUBLISHED ON THIS PAGE LAST FRIDAY DOUGLAS PAYNE DESCRIBED NICARAGUA'S GROWING ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH THE SOVIET BLOC
AND YESTERDAY ON THE WASHINGTON POST'S OP ED PAGE LA PRENSA PUBLISHER VIOLETA CHAMORRO DESCRIBED THE EXTENT OF PRESS CENSORSHIP

HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
<NOISE> HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
I AM ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
YOU CAN TOO
ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
RATHER THAT WASN'T A QUESTION
IT WAS A STATEMENT
MAY I ASK A QUESTION ABOUT
<NOISE> WHILE FORMER EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS FACE JAIL FOR NON CRIMES <NOISE> CONGRESS IS ABUSING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN SEEKING IMMUNITY FROM LIBEL SUITS
<NOISE> THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D. C. CIRCUIT HELD LAST NOVEMBER THAT CONGRESSMEN CAN BE SUED FOR STATEMENTS MADE OUTSIDE CONGRESS
LAWYER STEVEN ROSS WHOSE BOSS IS HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT APPEALED TO THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT WITH NO SUCCESS
<NOISE> BUT ROBERT BORK HAS LEFT THE COURT SO MR. ROSS WILL TRY AGAIN
THE CIRCUIT HAS NEVER GRANTED A SECOND TRY BUT MR. ROSS SEEMS TO THINK IT'S WORTH ANOTHER SHOT
<NOISE> THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
<NOISE> FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER VEHICLES FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS
BUT WHEN THE SUBJECT IS FARMING HE CAN'T MASK HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
<NOISE> I THOUGHT I'D BE IN A HECK OF A LOT BETTER POSITION BY NOW HE SAYS
BEFORE THE DROUGHT I THOUGHT WE HAD A GOOD SHOT AT A GOOD YEAR
THE BOND ISSUANCE PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL
AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEAR STALLED ANALYSTS SAID
<NOISE> IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR
<NOISE> THE LACK OF MARKET DEPTH YESTERDAY ENABLED SEVERAL LARGE BUY ORDERS TO SPARK THE DOLLAR RALLY
<NOISE> ONE NEW YORK TRADER SAID HE WITNESSED THE CURRENCY'S VALUE JUMP AS HIS BANK EXECUTED A PURCHASE ORDER FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN SEVERAL CHUNKS
WHEN THERE ARE VERY FEW PLAYERS THAT KIND OF ORDER WILL MOVE THE MARKET SAID THE TRADER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED <NOISE>
<NOISE> THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAY IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR
THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE <NOISE> <NOISE> A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
<NOISE> SOME EXPERTS SAY THAT BECAUSE OF SWEEPING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY COULDN'T BE RE REGULATED EVEN IF PEOPLE WANTED
BUT THE CONTINUING DECONTROL IN THIS AREA ALSO SHOWS THAT THE REGULATORY RESURGENCE IS SELECTIVE
WHILE RULES ARE REVIVED TO DEAL WITH PUBLICIZED CONCERNS SUCH AS AIR AND RAIL SAFETY THE *GOVERNMENT* PULLBACK CONTINUES IN SUCH AREAS AS CONSUMER PROTECTION AND ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT
TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
<NOISE> FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
<NOISE> SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
<NOISE> THE *IRAN* CONTRA COMMITTEE ENDED ITS HEARINGS YESTERDAY IN A TORRENT OF MEMBERS' SPEECHES ABOUT LIES AND DECEIT
<NOISE> CONGRESS NOW TURNS TO ITS REWRITE OF THE GRAMM RUDMAN LAW WHICH HAS TARGETED THE FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DEFICIT OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHT BILLION
THE TARGET WILL BE RAISED BECAUSE MEMBERS IT SEEMS ARE NOT PREPARED TO KEEP THE SPENDING CUT PROMISES MADE WHEN IT WAS SET
<NOISE> NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
<NOISE> THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
<NOISE> THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
BRAZIL UNILATERALLY STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION OF FOREIGN BANK DEBT LAST FEBRUARY TWENTIETH
IT CITED WEAKENED FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD RESERVES
<NOISE> SINCE THEN ITS MEDIUM *TERM* AND LONG TERM FOREIGN BANK DEBT HAS CLIMBED TO MORE THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING INTEREST ARREARS
SO FAR THE EXECUTIVE SAYS HE HAS SIGNED UP FIFTY TWO FIELD ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AGENTS
<NOISE> BY YEAR END HE EXPECTS HIS AGENT INVESTOR GROUP COULD NUMBER TWO THOUSAND
HE ALSO HAS LURED THREE FORMER EXECUTIVES WHO WORKED WITH HIM AT I. T. T.'S UNIT
ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
<NOISE> BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
<NOISE> NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
<NOISE> A MERGER WITH MACY WHICH IS ROUGHLY HALF THE SIZE OF FEDERATED COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE LARGER RETAILER'S EXECUTIVES
MACY'S SMALLER SIZE COULD LEAVE THE FEDERATED OFFICERS WITH OPERATING POWER IN A COMBINED CONCERN
AND FEELINGS AT FEDERATED HAVE RUN HIGHER AGAINST CAMPEAU WHICH SURPRISED THE COMPANY WITH A HOSTILE BID LAST MONTH <NOISE>
HOWEVER CAMPEAU'S BID IS ALL CASH AND THE MACY BID ISN'T
INSTITUTIONALIZED AUDITING WOULD ALSO HELP REDUCE TAX EVASION
IF ACCOUNTING BECOMES INSTITUTIONALIZED IT WOULD ENABLE THE STATE TO COLLECT TAXES MORE EFFICIENTLY SAYS HAKAN ONCE A MANAGER OF ARTHUR YOUNG'S OFFICE IN ISTANBUL
<NOISE> NEARLY HALF OF ALL TAXABLE REVENUE GOES UNTAXED ACCORDING TO TURKEY'S FEDERAL TAX AUTHORITY
BUT AMERICAN EXPRESS INSISTS IT HAS NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT
THE ANSWER IS NO
NOT WHILE I'M HERE SAYS EDWIN COOPERMAN PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS'S CONSUMER CARD GROUP
<NOISE> THE SAME MENTALITY AFFECTED THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURES OF THE STORES MR. GARCIA SAID
HE OWNS THIRTY SEVEN BURGER KINGS IN FLORIDA BUT HE REFUSES TO PUT UP THE BUILDING THAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY BURGER KING
IT LOOKS LIKE A MATCHBOX
<NOISE> SOCIALIST REVOLUTION THE CARDS READ
<NOISE> THE STUDENTS FLASH A COLORFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE KOREAN FLAG
AND THEN IN A PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED MOVE LONG LIVE THE GREAT LEADER KIM IL SUNG
THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
HOLIDAY WAS ALSO VULNERABLE BECAUSE IT HADN'T MUCH CHANGED AND CONSUMERS HAD
THEY WERE MORE SOPHISTICATED AND WIDELY TRAVELED
THEY DEMANDED MORE AND INSTEAD OF GETTING BETTER MANY HOLIDAY INNS HAD GONE DOWNHILL
SOME WERE QUITE VEHEMENT IN RESISTING ANY CHANGE
IF A COMPANY DID THIS I WOULDN'T FOLLOW THEM ANYMORE SAID ONE NEW YORK ANALYST
ISSUERS OF ABBREVIATED ANNUAL REPORTS ARE REALLY SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR THE TYPICAL SHAREHOLDER SAID ANOTHER
THE U. S. COTTON INDUSTRY IS COST COMPETITIVE WITH THE MAJOR PRODUCING COUNTRIES BUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF FOREIGN COTTON PRODUCTION IS SUBSIDIZED
OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SUCH NON MARKET ECONOMIES AS CHINA AND RUSSIA
WITHOUT U. S. GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT OUR MARKETS ARE FORFEITED
INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION IS OFFERING FIVE HUNDRED SHARES OF TRANSFERABLE PREFERRED STOCK AT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH
THE SHARES CARRY AN INITIAL ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE OF FOUR POINT SIX TWO FIVE PERCENT
A NEW RATE WILL BE SET JUNE EIGHTH AND EVERY FORTY NINE DAYS THEREAFTER THROUGH A DUTCH AUCTION SAID SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED HEAD UNDERWRITER
IN A DUTCH AUCTION THE SHARES ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD AT FACE VALUE ONLY THE DIVIDEND RATE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
INTERNATIONAL LEASE AN AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANY SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES TO ACQUIRE AIRCRAFT AND TO RETIRE SHORT TERM DEBT
THE COMPANY IS BASED IN BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA
THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL
AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CONTRAS
SOME BANKS HAVE ALREADY TURNED CERTAIN DEBTS INTO SECURITIES WHICH SO FAR THEY HAVE HELD RATHER THAN SELLING
TO GET AROUND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT LIMITS ON DEBT RESERVES A GROUP OF JAPANESE BANKS TURNED SOME THIRD WORLD DEBT INTO PREFERRED STOCK EARLIER THIS YEAR
AND SHEARSON IS ABOUT TO START MARKETING A MUTUAL FUND TO BANKS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BANKS TO SWAP PHILIPPINE DEBT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THAT COUNTRY
AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED
HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER
I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN
BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID
BUT WESTIN HAS SHOWN UNSPECTACULAR ALBEIT STEADY EARNINGS IN RECENT YEARS AS COMPETITION HAS HEATED UP IN THE LUXURY HOTEL MARKET
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IT HAD OPERATING EARNINGS OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN IT EARNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
REVENUE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO V- GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER VEHICLES FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS
AMONG THE SEVENTY EIGHT BOND FUNDS TRACKED FOR THE ASSOCIATION WARDLEY GLOBAL SELECT STERLING BOND FUND TURNED IN THE QUARTER'S BEST RETURN OF ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
REFLECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE POUND BRITISH BOND FUNDS PERFORMED BEST AS A GROUP WITH A SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT MEDIAN RETURN
FUNDS HEAVILY INVESTED IN U. S. AND SWISS BONDS YIELDED THE QUARTER'S POOREST RETURNS
BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN THE U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
CURRENCY LOSSES COULD ALSO EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR
AND BUYING A FUND FOR MORE THAN ITS PORTFOLIO VALUE CAN BE TREACHEROUS SOME ANALYSTS SAY
TRITON LOOKS LIKE A LOVELY BOSTON SNOW A FEW DAYS AFTER A SNOWSTORM MARVELS MR. JOHNSON THE BUSY HEAD OF THE IMAGING TEAM'S TRITON GROUP
YOU SEE PILES OF WHITE SNOW AND PATCHES WHERE THE DIRT SHOWS THROUGH
MAYBE TRITON IS MORE LIKE A HUGE COMET THAN A MODEL FOR EARLY EARTH HE SPECULATES
DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES INCORPORATED IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR EIGHT PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT NINETY NINE AND A QUARTER
SEPARATELY ITS DILLARD INVESTMENT COMPANY UNIT IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SEVEN AND THREE EIGHTHS PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT PAR
BOTH NOTE ISSUES WILL PAY ACCRUED INTEREST FROM LAST THURSDAY
BOTH OFFERINGS ARE BEING UNDERWRITTEN BY GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY AND AREN'T REDEEMABLE BEFORE MATURITY
THE LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS BASED REALTOR SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO RETIRE DEBT TO FINANCE OPERATIONS AND FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES
THE INVESTMENT UNIT SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO BUY CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE GROWING OUT OF THE PARENT'S RETAIL SALES
PROCEEDS MAY ALSO BE USED TO RETIRE SHORT TERM BORROWINGS THE UNIT SAID
EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN STOCK PRICES TRADING VOLUME WASN'T OVERWHELMING
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPARED WITH A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION MONDAY
BUT TRADERS ASSERTED THAT MUCH OF THE LATE ACTIVITY CAME FROM PROFESSIONALS
THE RIVALS HAVE DISPUTED EACH OTHER'S CIRCULATION CLAIMS FOR YEARS
ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET <NOISE>
THE COMPANY SAID THE CHARGE IS RELATED TO THE CLOSING AND WRITE OFF OF VARIOUS MARGINAL AND UNPROFITABLE OPERATIONS
UNITED HEALTHCARE SAID IT WILL CLOSE AN UNPROFITABLE H. M. O. IN PHOENIX ARIZONA AND H. M. O. STARTUPS IN SIX CITIES
IT WILL ALSO RESERVE THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AGAINST INVESTMENTS AND LOANS TO H. M. O.S IN PITTSBURGH PHILADELPHIA AND THE CAROLINAS
WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED
AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTY THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
PRINCIPALS OF A. W. A NEWLY FORMED CORPORATION INCLUDE ARTHUR G. HAILAND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF AIR WIS WHO WAS REMOVED FROM THAT JOB AFTER THE PREVIOUS OFFER
HE REMAINS A DIRECTOR
AIR WIS IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR AIR WISCONSIN AN APPLETON WISCONSIN BASED COMMUTER AIRLINE
BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT DAY ISN'T WORRIED
WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAYS
WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
CONGRESS ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS OWN ABILITY TO PROTECT SECRETS
CURRENT PROCEDURES ALMOST REQUIRE AN OPERATION'S COVER TO BE BLOWN BEFORE THE OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE
IF CONGRESS HAD ADEQUATE SECURITY LAWS AND PROCEDURES WITH STIFF PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THE END RESULT PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE FRANK DISCUSSION NOT LESS
BUT THE PROPOSAL BY TEXACO'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER WHICH COULD LEAD TO HISTORY'S LARGEST ACQUISITION INVOLVES NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES
FIRST MR. ICAHN SAID TEXACO WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO SUBMIT THE BID TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL
I'M GIVING THEM FORTY EIGHT HOURS HE SAID
THE SCHOOL HAS VACILLATED WITH ITS SMOKING POLICY
LAST YEAR IT ALLOWED SMOKING ALONE AND IN SILENCE
BUT AS STUDENTS KNOW CIGARETTES KILL
SMOKING IS UN QUAKER LIKE AS WELL AS STUPID
MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE
HE ALSO SAID IT MIGHT ACCELERATE FURTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE LEVELING OFF
BUT THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY SAID HE HOPED THAT PRICE INCREASES LIKE THE LABOR SHORTAGE WOULD EASE IF THE LOCAL ECONOMY SLOWS AS HE HAS PREDICTED
TO MANY OBSERVERS THE SITE WILL BE A BONANZA FOR WHOEVER DEVELOPS IT
IT'S ONE OF THE FINEST PIECES OF LAND THAT YOU CAN FIND SAYS SANFORD GOODKIN A MARINA DEL REY CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSULTANT

ADDS ROB MAGUIRE OF MAGUIRE THOMAS PARTNERS A LOS ANGELES BASED OFFICE DEVELOPER IT'S A TERRIFIC LOCATION
AMONG THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DID MESSRS.
BOESKY OR STEINBERG RECEIVE INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET MERGER TALKS
DID THEIR LARGE POTENTIALLY UNFRIENDLY POSITIONS IN HARRIS ENCOURAGE HARRIS OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE A SALE
WERE THEY WORKING TOGETHER SEPARATELY OR IN CONCERT WITH DREXEL OFFICIALS TO BRING ABOUT A SALE OF HARRIS
IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAX AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
THE LAW EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN CATCH TWENTY TWO
YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO FILL OUT YOUR OWN TAX RETURN ROGER TELLS ME
BUT THE LAW ALSO SAYS YOU PROBABLY NO LONGER CAN DEDUCT THE COST OF HIRING PROFESSIONAL HELP
IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL CHECKING ACCOUNTS AND A MONEY MARKET FUND HE STILL KEEPS AN OLD FASHIONED SAVINGS ACCOUNT
THE REASON
TO BE FAIR TO THE BANK MR. MERRITT SAYS
IN EXCHANGE FOR GOOD BANKING SERVICE HE FEELS IT'S ONLY REASONABLE TO ALLOW THE BANK A DOLLOP OF LOW COST FUNDS

CALTON INCORPORATED A FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP NEW JERSEY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER SAID SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A RECAPITALIZATION PLAN CREATING A NEW CLASS OF STOCK
THE CLASS B. SHARES WHICH HAVE TEN TIMES THE VOTING POWER OF COMMON WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO CURRENT HOLDERS
CLASS B. SHARES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO REGULAR COMMON BUT GENERALLY WON'T BE TRANSFERABLE
SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD JULY THIRTY FIRST WILL GET ONE CLASS B. SHARE FOR EACH COMMON SHARE HELD
COMPANIES OFTEN CREATE DUAL CLASSES OF STOCK TO CONCENTRATING THE VOTING RIGHTS IN FRIENDLY HANDS THEREBY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM MAKING UNFRIENDLY TAKEOVER BIDS
THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC

ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
MOST ANALYSTS SAID THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OF THE TWO BANKS MAKE A GOOD FIT
GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS A STRONG NETWORK IN AFRICA WHILE AMRO HAS MORE OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND FAR EAST
AND WHILE GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS AN IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL BANKING OPERATION AMRO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES FOR ITS CLIENTS

THE REPORT DOESN'T PREDICT ANY IMMINENT CRASH
INDEED ITS DETAILED ANALYSIS CITES SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS
SOLID USER DEMAND GENERATED BY HONG KONG'S ROBUST ECONOMY AND RISING INCOMES IS ONE FACTOR
ANOTHER IS HEAVY INVESTMENT INFLOWS FROM JAPAN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND TAIWAN
BUT THIS RELIANCE ALSO RAISES THE STAKES IN THE FARMERS RACE
THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL BURKE AN ANALYST AT LONDON STOCKBROKERS KLEINWORT GRIEVESON SECURITIES
AND YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS A LOSER WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN AMERICA
IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES

KIDDER PEABODY FOUNDED FOUR YEARS EARLIER LONG HAS BEEN A SOCIALLY WELL CONNECTED AND PROFITABLE INVESTMENT BANK
BUT ITS POWER ON WALL STREET EBBED IN RECENT YEARS AS IT WAS OVERTAKEN BY LARGER MORE AGGRESSIVE FIRMS

THE PAYMENT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES APPARENTLY BOUGHT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE DREXEL FINANCING AND A PROMISSORY NOTE
BROOKS ITSELF BORROWED MONEY TO FUND THE THIRTY MILLION CASH PORTION
BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
BALLY'S DRIVE INTO THE HOTEL CASINO INDUSTRY HAS MADE HEALTH CLUBS AN INCREASINGLY AWKWARD FIT ANALYSTS SAID AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DIVESTITURE
BY SHEDDING THE HEALTH CLUB LINE BALLY COULD FOCUS ON ITS REMAINING OPERATIONS GAMBLING MACHINES STATE LOTTERIES AND AMUSEMENT CENTERS

LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS

FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS
THE BIG SPENDER ROUTINE ASKED ABOUT MY LIQUID ASSETS I TOLD ONE CALLER OF THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR IN MY MONEY MARKET FUND
LUNCH MONEY HE SNIFFED
BELIEVE IT OR NOT I'VE SPENT AT LEAST THAT ON LUNCH A COUPLE OF TIMES
U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EITHER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
A MAN WHO DOES THIS THE CONGRESSMEN PROFESS TO BELIEVE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
CERTAINLY HE CAN'T ASSOCIATE WITH THE BOY SCOUTS WHO INHABIT CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOMS
OFF WITH HIS HEAD
A RECENT VOTING STUDY BY THE COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE TRIES TO MEASURE WHAT CONGRESSMEN ACTUALLY DO TO LOWER COMPETITIVE BARRIERS AND END CORPORATE SUBSIDIES NOT WHAT THEY SAY
IN THE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS THE AVERAGE HOUSE MEMBER VOTED WITH C. E. I. ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE TIME
MEMBERS OF THE COMPETITIVENESS CAUCUS FARED WORSE THAN THE HOUSE AS A WHOLE THEIR AVERAGE SCORE WAS ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT
G. O. P. REPRESENTATIVE TOM DELAY OF TEXAS CALLS THEM MEMBERS OF THE PROTECTIONIST CAUCUS
WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS ON IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN SOME KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT TO WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
IN SHORT FALL OF IRAN TO THE AYATOLLAH WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW
TWO PORTALS INSTEAD OF ONE HEADED BY TWO FINE SCIENTISTS MAY MEAN SPEEDIER HANDLING OF NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS DOCTOR JENNINGS SAID
BUT IF THAT DOOR IS JUST PAINTED ON HE ADDED IT MAY NOT CHANGE A LOT
THE EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE IS MADE FROM THE VIRUS FROM WHICH SMALLPOX VACCINE IS MANUFACTURED
GENES FROM THE SURFACE PROTEIN OF THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS OR H. I. V. WHICH CAUSES AIDS ARE INSERTED INTO SMALLPOX VACCINE VIRUS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TECHNIQUES
A CONTROL GROUP IN THE STUDY WILL RECEIVE A SMALLPOX VACCINE
BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
PATTEN RETAINS LAND SPECIALISTS WHO KNOW THE REGULATORY ROPES AND HOW TO GET SUBDIVISIONS APPROVED
IN AT LEAST TWO INSTANCES PATTEN SPECIALISTS HAVE BEEN ON TOWN PLANNING BOARDS WHERE PATTEN HAD PROJECTS PENDING THOUGH THEY ABSTAINED FROM VOTING
IN MAINE A KEY SPOKESMAN IS A FORMER STATE LEGISLATOR
BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONG OTHER THINGS
MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY S- NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES
BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP *BURNUP* AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST
BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COMPANIES WERE EXCHANGING SUITS THAT HAVE LINGERED IN THE COURTS EVER SINCE
MERITOR ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
ITS DEPOSITS ARE STILL INSURED BY FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
<NOISE> BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEARS HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
OTHER ENTRANTS OFFER SUCH PEN NAMES AS GRANNY MR. DISCUSSION ANNA DARLING DEAR JOHN AND BEA READY
I SUGGEST A HIP MACHO NAME WITH QUICK READER IDENTIFICATION STAN LANDERS
I CAN PICTURE MY READERS IN A BAR AFTER WORK HEY DID YOU READ STAN THE MAN LANDERS THIS MORNING
THAT GUY GIVES GREAT ADVICE
NOWHERE IS THE SHOCK GREATER THAN IN TOWNS LIKE OBERHAUSEN IN THE RUHR VALLEY WEST GERMANY'S INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND
HERE UNLIKE IN MOST OF EUROPE THE INDUSTRY REMAINS IN PRIVATE HANDS AND BOASTS SOME OF THE MOST MODERN PLANTS TO BE IN FOUND ANYWHERE
NOT ONLY ARE THEY EFFICIENT THEY HAVE SHIFTED OVER THE YEARS TO THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY SPECIALTY STEELS THAT BRING HIGHER PROFIT MARGINS
THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
THE THREE DIRECTORS WERE AMONG THE FIVE WHO REJECTED THE LEBOW OFFER WITH THREE INSIDE DIRECTORS ABSTAINING
THEY HAD SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY WOULD FAVOR AN ACQUISITION UPON TERMS WHICH WERE INDEPENDENTLY APPRAISED AS FAIR BY SHAREHOLDERS
THEY REJECTED THE EARLIER OFFER BECAUSE FIRST BOSTON CORP; WAS UNABLE TO RENDER A FAIRNESS OPINION
<NOISE> COMPUTER DO MOST CHARTING THESE DAYS BUT DIEHARDS SAY DRAWING THEM BY HAND GIVES A BETTER FEEL FOR THE MARKET
THE COMPUTER DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT ABERRATIONS LIKE THIS *SAYS* MR. ELIADES WHO CHARTS ELECTRONICALLY AS WELL AS MANUALLY
YOU ADD ON FIVE SHEETS OF PAPER YOU KNOW HOW THE MARKET IS DOING
MR. FORBES SAID HE HAD HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
I ASSURE YOU THAT MR. FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
MR. FORBES ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME
<NOISE> ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TALKS SURPRISED ANALYSTS AND FAILED TO IMPRESS INVESTORS
BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES FELL TWENTY FIVE PENCE FOR FORTY FOUR CENTS TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE PENCE IN LATE TRADING YESTERDAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
THE HANDFUL OF ROVER SHARES TRADING JUMPED NINETEEN PENCE TO EIGHTY SIX PENCE AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT BUT FELL BACK TO EIGHTY TWO PENCE
MR. ZIA SAID THAT DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES THE RESISTANCE WOULD OVERTHROW THE KABUL REGIME
LOOK AT THE PALESTINIANS THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS FOR FORTY YEARS HE SAID
THEY HAVEN'T ACHIEVED WHAT SEVEN DIVIDED AFGHAN PARTIES HAVE ACHIEVED IN EIGHT YEARS
IF THE RESISTANT FEUD OVER POWER ONCE THE KABUL REGIME FALLS HE SAID I WOULDN'T CARE LESS
AT FIRST THE REBELS TRIED TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THEIR HOME GROWN MULES
BUT THESE ANIMALS WERE A SCRAWNY LOT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS AND WHEN THEY WEREN'T WORKED TO DEATH THEY WERE GUNNED DOWN BY THE SOVIETS
THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES
THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE
THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY
THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE
SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED
WITNESS THE RECENT DISPUTE OVER CONTINUING N. I. H.'S ARTIFICIAL HEART PROGRAM
THE WARRANTY PRICE INCREASES APPEAR TO BE CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THE UNDERLYING COSTS
COMPUTERS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY RELIABLE IN RECENT YEARS REDUCING THE NEED FOR SERVICE
DIGITAL CITED ITS LOWER COSTS WHEN IT INTRODUCED ITS FREE WARRANTY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
<NOISE> CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION IS THE POT AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW FOR BOXING'S BIGGEST FIGHTS
IT PROVIDED FOR INSTANCE THE LARGEST SLICE OF THE RECORD SEVENTY SIX MILLION ESTIMATED GROSS FROM THE RECENT SUGAR RAY LEONARD MARVIN HAGLER BOUT
MEANWHILE YOUNG HEAVYWEIGHT SENSATION MIKE TYSON PROMISES TO GENERATE CLOSED CIRCUIT QUALITY FIGHTS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
BUT THE ORDER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GENERATED INTENSE CONTROVERSY BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CABINET
IT BECAME SAID ONE CREDITOR THE POINT OF IMPACT FOR DEBATE ON THE ENTIRE RESCHEDULING PACKAGE AND FOREIGN DEBT
IN SEPTEMBER THE PRESIDENT'S MOST POWERFUL ADVISER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY JOKER ARROYO TOLD CONGRESS THAT MR. ONGPIN TRICKED MRS. AQUINO INTO SIGNING THE ORDER
TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
LINCOLN HAS ABOUT TWO MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
YESTERDAY IN COMPOSITE TRADING ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE LINCOLN CLOSED THE ELEVEN POINT ONE TWO FIVE A SHARE UP TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS
BASED ON THAT PRICE LINCOLN'S COMMON SHARES HAVE A TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION
WE'VE HAD A MAJOR RUN UP LAST WEEK PARTICULARLY FRIDAY NOTED MR. POLCE
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE DOLLAR CAME UP TOO FAST THE MARKET'S BEEN CONSOLIDATING ITS GAINS
MOREOVER MR. POLCE SAID THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE TILL THE JAPANESE TRADE NUMBERS COME OUT
RETAIL SALES ARE A CLOSELY WATCHED INDICATOR OF CONSUMER SPENDING
THEY TOTAL MORE THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT THE VALUE OF ALL THE GOODS AND SERVICES PRODUCED IN THE NATION
BUT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S MONTHLY ESTIMATE BASED ON EARLY REPORTS FROM RETAILERS FREQUENTLY IS REVISED SUBSTANTIALLY
THE FIGURES ARE ADJUSTED FOR SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS INCLUDING THIS YEAR'S EARLY EASTER BUT NOT FOR INFLATION
BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT DAY ISN'T WORRIED
WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAYS
WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
THE EQUITY PEOPLE AND THE FUTURES PEOPLE HAVE JOINT AND MUTUAL INTERESTS SAID RICHARD L. SANDOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED IN CHICAGO
I APPLAUD THE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO GET SOME JOINT ACTION
IT'S A MILESTONE IN THAT REGARD
BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE *INSTEAD* MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN THE TOMPKINS COUNTY
WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
IN MY MINISTRY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALTERNATIVES OF INDEPENDENCE
THERE ARE ALREADY TWO GERMANYS AND TWO KOREAS
BUT AFTER CLOSE STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT INDEPENDENCE IS A DEAD END
WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE US
AND IN THAT CASE WHAT'S THE USE OF DECLARING INDEPENDENCE
THEN IN JUNE CAME A CASE INVOLVING COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ATTEMPTED TO THROW A TUPPERWARE PARTY AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
THEY WERE FORBIDDEN BY UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS WHO CITED RULES PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES ON CAMPUS
THE STUDENTS SUED THE SCHOOL BUT THE SUPREME COURT HELD IN FAVOR OF THE UNIVERSITY BAN
THE BUNDESBANK HAS REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION
THESE DAYS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERS AND READ ABOUT WEST GERMAN FEARS OF REIGNITING INFLATION
YOU HAVE TO PINCH YOURSELF T- TO REMEMBER THAT THE INFLATION RUNNING NEAR ZERO IN APRIL IS NOW RUNNING BELOW ZERO
THE E. M. S. APPARENTLY MUST BE REALIGNED AND THE FRANC DEVALUED TO ACCOMMODATE THE GERMAN TASTE FOR DEFLATION
THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
HE JOINED THE M. FIFTEEN STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
BANK AID OKLAHOMA SENATOR BOREN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS FROM STATES HARD HIT BY BANK CLOSING MULL WAYS TO EASE THE FALLOUT
A MAJOR CONCERN IS A DROP IN REAL ESTATE VALUES WHEN EXTENSIVE LANDHOLDINGS OF FAILED BANKS ARE SOLD
ONE POSSIBLE GOAL A REGIONAL CONSORTIUM TO HELP PROP UP LAND PRICES
THE COMPANY ATTRIBUTED THE EARNINGS INCREASE TO GROWING POPULARITY OF ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH IS USED WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP.'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND COMPATIBLE MODELS
THE COMPANY ALSO SAID INITIAL ORDERS FOR ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM FOR APPLE COMPUTER INC.'S MACINTOSH HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING
THE SYSTEM FOR THE MACINTOSH WAS INTRODUCED IN AUGUST
THE SUPREME COURT TURNED ITS BACK ON THE BASIC WISDOM OF THE COMMERCE *CLAUSE* LAST APRIL IN THE CASE OF THE C. T. S. CORP. VERSUS
DYNAMICS CORP.
THIS WAS THE CASE THAT UPHELD INDIANA'S LAW *REGULATING* CORPORATE TAKEOVERS WHICH WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN FEDERAL LAWS TO PROTECT TARGETS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BIDDERS
THE RESULT IS A CRUSH OF ANTI TAKEOVER LAWS IN A DOZEN STATES SO FAR
THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES THE BILL AND NO SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE
THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE'S SUBCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE WILL HOLD HEARINGS O- ON THE MEASURE LATE THIS YEAR OR EARLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT A SPOKESMAN SAID
CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES SAID THE LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FACE GREATER OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE THAN IN THE HOUSE
NORTHGATE DECLINED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF AN EXPECTED GAIN ON THE SALE
THE COMPANY SAID NET PROCEEDS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE MAINLY USED TO FINANCE GOLD MINING ACQUISITIONS
NORTHGATE SAID IT WILL SEEK PURE GOLD MINES ONLY
OCEAN SPRAY SAYS IT SIMPLY CAN'T SELL PURE CRANBERRY JUICE BECAUSE IT'S TOO TART TASTING
SO WHY NOT EXPLAIN THAT FACT ON THE LABEL
CONSUMERS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME OUR PRODUCT IS LESS NUTRITIOUS THAN PURE ORANGE OR APPLE JUICE A SPOKESMAN SAYS
BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY SO
<NOISE> MACY'S IS OFFERING SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS A SHARE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF FEDERATED'S SHARES PLUS STOCK IN A COMBINED FEDERATED MACY FOR THE REMAINDER
THE STOCK COMPONENT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL BID WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY ESTIMATED AT ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION
MACY'S ADVISERS HOWEVER PRIVATELY VALUED IT AT BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR COMPARABLE TO CAMPEAU'S PROPOSAL
HOW SERIOUS AND PATIENT INVESTORS INTEREST IS WILL BE TESTED NEXT MONTH
A GOVERNMENT OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY IS SET TO AUCTION OFF THE HYATT REGENCY MANILA
THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION
GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS THE FIRST FANTASY HOTEL IS A HYATT BUILT FOR SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION ON THE ISLAND OF MAUI IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN ROOM RESORT INCLUDES A ONE ACRE POOL SURROUNDED BY ARTIFICIAL ROCKS
GUESTS SWIM THROUGH MAN MADE WATERFALLS ZIP DOWN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOOT TALL WATER SLIDE AND OBSERVE FLOCKS OF *SWANS* PENGUINS AND FLAMINGOS
IN CHINA BASKETS HAVE LITTLE MATERIAL VALUE MS. TAYLOR SAID
THE PRICE OF A TYPICAL MARKET BASKET RANGES FROM A QUARTER TO A FEW DOLLARS IN EQUIVALENT U. S. CURRENCY
NO ONE COLLECTS BASKETS OR DISPLAYS THEM
BASKETS ARE SIMPLY USED AND USED UNTIL THEY WEAR OUT
THE SEEDS OF NATWEST'S INVESTMENT BANKING PROBLEMS WERE SOWN MONTHS BEFORE THE DEREGULATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
RIVALS SUCH AS *BARCLAYS* AND S. G. WARBURG GROUP P. L. C. ASSEMBLED POWERHOUSE CONGLOMERATES OF *BROKERAGE* TRADING AND FIXED INCOME SECURITY FIRMS <NOISE>
BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
THE SUIT CHARGES THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
THE FRANCHISE FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES
MR. GREENSPAN COMPLIED
WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I GATHER IS HAPPENING HERE HE SAID
JUST WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE DAM BROKE WHICH LED US TO A RATHER SURPRISING END
COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE SEEKING THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR LINES LENDING TO BLUE CHIP CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DRIED UP
<NOISE> BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
THAT LINE MAY BE WEARING THIN WITH PRIVATE BANKS
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF SOUND POLICY MOVES
OTHERWISE WHY KEEP POURING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD
IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND ACCORD THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ASSERTED THAT THE DOLLAR HAD DECLINED ENOUGH
THEY PLEDGED TO INTERVENE JOINTLY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS TO KEEP EXCHANGE RATES AT ABOUT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS
THE DOLLAR REMAINED STABLE FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE ACCORD WAS REACHED BUT THEN BEGAN TO SLUMP AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN
CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED AND EVENTUALLY HELPED ARREST THE SLIDE
MR. TRUMP HAD CHARACTERIZED HIS PURCHASES OF U. A. L. STOCK AS AN INVESTMENT IN A COMPANY WITH *UNDERVALUED* ASSETS
HE HAS SPOKEN OUT FREQUENTLY AGAINST U. A. L. MANAGEMENT IN RECENT WEEKS
HE HAS CALLED U. A. L.'S PLAN TO CHANGE ITS NAME TO ALLEGIS CORP. A WASTE OF MONEY AND THAT ALLEGIS SOUNDS LIKE SOME NEW DISEASE
THE RECAPITALIZATION WAS PROPOSED TO THWART A TAKEOVER EFFORT BY BRITISH PRINTING AND COMMUNICATIONS CORP.
THE OXFORD ENGLAND PUBLISHING AND PRINTING CONCERN CONTROLLED BY ROBERT MAXWELL FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK TO BLOCK THE RECAPITALIZATION
A COURT VICTORY WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR MR. MAXWELL <NOISE> TO MAKE A NEW OFFER FOR HARCOURT
AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM
THE SKY ISN'T FALLING SAYS ROBERT GERARD THE HEAD OF MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INCORPORATED'S *MUNICIPAL* FINANCE DIVISION
SECURITIES UNDERWRITING ISN'T THE ANSWER FOR ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL LOANS
DETAILS OF THE NEW OFFER WEREN'T DISCLOSED
THE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A WAGE FREEZE LOWER WAGES FOR STARTING EMPLOYEES AND OTHER CONCESSIONS REJECTED BY THE UNIONS
<NOISE> THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT EXPIRES DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST
THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A FIVE PERCENT WAGE RAISE IN EACH OF TWO YEARS MORE JOB SECURITY AND GUARANTEES AGAINST SUBCONTRACTING
AFTER LEAVING THE SENATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE MR. PROXMIRE SAID HE PLANS TO REMAIN ACTIVE AND HOPES TO WRITE ANOTHER BOOK
I'M NOT RETIRING FROM WORK HE SAID
I'M GOING TO WORK HARD <NOISE>
DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
I COME WITH NO BAGGAGE WITH NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT THE BEST REGULATORY METHOD OR THE BEST WAY THE MARKET SHOULD OPERATE
I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION <NOISE> TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
THAT SAME ORGANIZATION HAS REMAINED IN PLACE EVER SINCE
BUSH BRIGADE UNITS HOLD ANNUAL MEETINGS
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN NEWSLETTER
IT HAS BECOME A KIND OF PRIVATE CLUB WHICH DOLE SUPPORTERS SAY IS BASICALLY ELITIST
SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSATIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OP- OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
BUT HIS AIDES SAY THAT HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I AM NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS INDICATE ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SALES ARE BEGINNING TO PAY OFF
LAST YEAR THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS TRAINING TO IMPROVE SERVICE
IN FEBRUARY IT LAUNCHED RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURING COMEDIAN MARTIN MULL AND IN APRIL IT UNVEILED A NEW MENU
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT THE OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAID THAT MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
SPECULATION HEATS UP ON VOLCKER'S FUTURE
SOME BELIEVE HIS ODDS OF BEING REAPPOINTED THIS SUMMER ARE ENHANCED BY THE WEAKENED POSITION OF WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF REGAN WHO WANTS VOLCKER OUT
YET MANY INSIDERS DOUBT THAT VOLCKER WHO IS RESISTING THE ADMINISTRATION ON REGULATORY MATTERS WILL BE KEPT BARRING A FINANCIAL CRISIS
HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET

FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A SHARE AFTER TAXES
IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR KODAK SAYS ALEX
BROWN ANALYST OTIS BENTLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
IT REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE
THE PURCHASING MANAGERS' COMPOSITE INDEX REGISTERED FIFTY SEVEN POINT THREE PERCENT FOR JUNE FRACTIONALLY BELOW MAY'S FIFTY SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT
AN INDEX READING ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT GENERALLY INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS EXPANDING WHILE AN INDEX BELOW FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES A DECLINE ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATION
THE INDEX HAS AVERAGED FIFTY FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER CLAIM THAT IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS NOT THE DOGS THEMSELVES ARE TO BLAME FOR THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATTACKS
THEY'RE AMORAL SAYS AN OFFICIAL OF THE UNITED S- KENNEL CLUB A PRESTIGIOUS PEDIGREE ASSOCIATION
THEY'LL DO WHAT THE TRAINER ALLOWS THEM TO DO
MR. WASHINGTON GREW UP IN CHICAGO POLITICS

BRANIFF CHAIRMAN JAY A. *PRITZKER* AND HIS FAMILY CONTROL NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF BRANIFF'S VOTING STOCK
BRANIFF'S PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS WOULD GIVE PAN AM CORPORATION COMMON SHAREHOLDERS A FIFTY FIVE PERCENT INTEREST IN THE MERGED COMPANY
BRANIFF SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND PAN AM'S UNION EMPLOYEES TWENTY PERCENT IN EXCHANGE FOR WAGE SAVINGS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS
STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAY THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
MOREOVER SOME HOUSING SPECIALISTS SAY PERMIT ACTIVITY IS A POOR INDICATOR OF FUTURE STARTS ARGUING THAT IT REFLECTS CURRENT HOUSING ACTIVITY RATHER THAN PREDICTING FUTURE ACTIVITY
<NOISE> THEY PREDICT THAT INSTEAD OF FALLING HOUSING STARTS WILL IMPROVE IN COMING MONTHS IN REACTION TO INCREASING NEW AND EXISTING HOME SALES
ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS TREND WILL BE THE SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS BEEN BATTERED BY RECESSION AND A HOUSING GLUT
AFTER THREE MONTHS ON THE JOB SESSIONS SAYS HIS AGENDA IS JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP
HE HAS INDICATED THAT PRIORITIES WOULD INCLUDE BANK FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND TIGHTENING F. B. I. PROCEDURES FOR UNDERCOVER <NOISE> PROBES
CRITICS SAY THAT UNDER HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH THE F. B. I. FAILED TO DEFEND ITSELF QUICKLY ENOUGH AGAINST RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INVESTIGATIONS
THE TOKYO FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET IS CLOSED ON SATURDAYS
EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS WERE CLOSED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EXCEPT MILAN WHERE PRICES EDGED UP IN FRIDAY'S SESSION

RECENT COVERAGE OF THE CLOSING OF LONG ISLAND LIGHTING COMPANY'S NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BRINGS TO LIGHT A FASCINATING IRONY
<NOISE> THE VICTORY CELEBRATION OF THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE PLANT MAY BE SHORT LIVED
WITHOUT THIS PLANT LONG ISLAND STANDS A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF MAJOR SHORTAGES IN ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES DURING ITS EVER INCREASING PEAK DEMAND PERIODS
THIS LACK OF RELIABILITY WILL BE A SIGNAL TO BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY THAT LONG ISLAND IS NOT A DESIRABLE PLACE TO LOCATE
MEANWHILE LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL TAXPAYERS WILL BE JOINING LITCO RATEPAYERS IN FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE UNUSED FACILITY
THESE SAME RATEPAYERS WILL BE FORCED TO PAY TOP MARKET PRICE <NOISE> FOR ELECTRICITY IMPORTED INTO THEIR SYSTEM
<NOISE> WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE BILLION OF REPORTED STOCK ASSETS THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS CONTROL A SIZABLE CHUNK OF PENSION ASSETS AND PRIVATE PORTFOLIOS
INVESTMENT ADVISERS TEND TO BE SMALL PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHOSE OWNERS MANAGE THE PORTFOLIOS
THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES
AS THE MARKET CONTINUED ITS UPWARD MARCH IN EARLY JANUARY AN ALREADY MEAGER BEAR POPULATION DWINDLED FURTHER
IT'S TOUGH TO FIGHT THE TAPE SAYS STANLEY SALVIGSEN THE STILL BEARISH CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY
THE MARKET HAS BEATEN THE BEARS INTO SUBMISSION
ADDS MICHAEL METZ A MARKET STRATEGIST AT OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY WHO HAS HIMSELF REMAINED BEARISH THERE'S NOTHING THAT WILL CONVERT A BEAR LIKE AN UP MARKET
<NOISE> IT MIGHT BE SAID BY WAY OF REJOINDER THAT CONGRESSIONAL LIBERALS WILL BLITHELY ENACT ALL PROPOSED SOCIAL POLICIES <NOISE> THAT ARE POPULAR AND THEN CUT THE MILITARY BUDGET DRASTICALLY
THIS IS POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY <NOISE>
IT IS A LOT EASIER TO FORM A CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY AGAINST DRASTIC CUTS IN DEFENSE THAN AGAINST RELATIVELY MODEST EXPENDITURES ON PARTICULAR SOCIAL PROGRAMS
MAYBE IT IS SUGGESTED THERE IS AN EASIER WAY
WHAT ABOUT FIBERGLAS GONDOLAS <NOISE>
AFTER ALL HE IS REMINDED SOMEBODY IN GERMANY HAS BUILT ONE

MR. REAGAN NAMED SENIOR DIPLOMAT AND FINANCIER J. WILLIAM *MIDDENDORF* THE SECOND THE FORMER U. S. AMBASSADOR TO THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AS CHAIRMAN
IN THE LATEST QUARTER NET INTEREST INCOME MARGINS DECLINED TO FOUR POINT EIGHT SEVEN PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT A YEAR AGO
<NOISE> THE DECLINE REFLECTED LOWER LOAN YIELDS AND REDUCED INVESTMENT INCOME AFTER THE SALE OF HIGH YIELDING BONDS IN LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER
IT ALSO REFLECTED THE EFFECT OF TAX OVERHAUL WHICH REDUCED THE BENEFITS OF MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
FIRST UNION HAS ASSETS OF TWENTY FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> A SPOKESMAN FOR I. M. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE CHARGES
NEITHER OF THE RECAREY BROTHERS NOR MESSRS.
FERNANDEZ AND VILLA DEL REY COULD BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
<NOISE> WE'VE BEEN PONDERING THE SIXTEEN COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT RETURNED AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR DISCONNECTING ODOMETERS ON NEW CARS THAT ITS EMPLOYEES WERE TEST DRIVING
MANY OF THE SOME SIXTY THOUSAND CARS AND TRUCKS WERE DRIVEN FOR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILES
LEE IACOCCA HAS NOW CALLED THIS PRACTICE DUMB AND STUPID
HE HAS A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A NICE MAN
CRITICS SAY HE IS CAPTIVATED BY HIS OWN ELOQUENCE
<NOISE> TRUE HE SAYS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
NINE OF THE TEN DEATHS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS OCCURRED WHEN CHILDREN WERE STRANGLED BY STRINGS USED TO TIE THE PACIFIERS AROUND THEIR NECKS
COMMISSION REGULATIONS PROHIBIT THE SALE OF PACIFIERS WITH STRINGS AND REQUIRE A LABEL WARNING AGAINST THIS PRACTICE
ANY FURTHER EFFORT TO REDUCE THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH PACIFIERS WOULD DIVERT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM GREATER DANGERS AND THE WARNINGS PROBABLY WOULD CAUSE NEEDLESS WORRY
THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
EACH CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE SHARE THAT ISN'T TENDERED WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CASH DOVER SAID
<NOISE> THE OFFER BEGAN TODAY AND IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME JULY TWENTIETH
<NOISE> ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
GIVEN THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IT'S A GOOD USE OF THE CASH SAID WILLIAM R. YOUNG AN ANALYST WITH DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT *INCORPORATED*
THEY'RE DEFINITELY UNDERVALUED
FOR A PREMIER CHEMICAL COMPANY TO CARRY SUCH A DISCOUNT NEAR THE END OF AN ECONOMIC CYCLE SEEMS SILLY TO ME
A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS IS ALREADY WREAKING HAVOC IN MANY OF CHINA'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES
A FACTORY THAT MAKES NIKE SHOES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE HAS TO RUN A GENERATOR THREE DAYS A WEEK TO STAY IN OPERATION
THE PLANT'S TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ARE STOCKPILING COAL AND OIL FOR POWER IN CASE THEIR SUPPLIES GET CUT OFF
MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
<NOISE> AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE
RICHARD MACDONALD AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SAID THE RESULTS WERE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
THE IMPRESSIVE THING IS THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE MADE IN COST SAVINGS HE ADDED
FOR EXAMPLE TIME RECENTLY SAID IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH ITS MAGAZINE DEVELOPMENT GROUP A MOVE MR. MACDONALD SAID COULD SHAVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS
THE F. S. L. I. C. FUND IS SUPPOSED TO COVER INSURED DEPOSITS OF EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NATION'S THREE THOUSAND FEDERALLY INSURED THRIFTS
EVEN THE BANK BOARD'S STATED ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES IS THE LOWEST RATIO OF RESERVES TO DEPOSITS EVER
ALSO PENDING ARE REQUESTS FOR MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS TO TROUBLED THRIFTS
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WALK PAST ANYTHING I BELIEVED TO BE WRONG WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING MR. KAGLER SAYS
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YEAH BUT YOU THINK TOO MUCH IS WRONG
MAYBE I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIPLOMATIC
BUT NO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY
I DON'T CHOOSE TO LIVE THIS WAY
EATING IS MY PASTIME AND EATING IN TEXAS IS AN ADVENTURE
BUT LAST FALL MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO CHANGE MY DIET AT LEAST UNTIL I LOWERED MY CHOLESTEROL LEVEL
THE FACILITIES ARE IN BEVERLY AND DANVERS MASSACHUSETTS AND IN CHESHIRE CONNECTICUT
HEALTH AND REHABILITATION IS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST
CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS BASED GREENERY WHICH OWNS NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE TRUST OPERATES NURSING HOMES
THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM
U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND A TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO
MAKING MATTERS WORSE THE HARVEST RIPENING IN THE FIELDS PROMISES TO BE A MONSTER PORTENDING RECORD POST HARVEST SUPPLIES OF CORN AND A GLUT OF OTHER COMMODITIES
TO HELP CUT PRODUCTION THE U. S. IS PAYING FARMERS AN ANNUAL RENT FOR TEN YEARS TO IDLE EROSION PRONE CROP LAND UNDER A CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
WHAT HAPPENS NOW
THAT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS WHETHER MANAGEMENT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE WORKERS AND WHETHER UNION LEADERS CAN CONTROL THE RANK AND FILE
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON EITHER COUNT
INDEED LABOR EXPERTS SAY THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE THAT SOUTH KOREA CAN LAY A FOUNDATION FOR LABOR RELATIONS THAT MIGHT CALM WORKER UNREST SOON
THE DEBARTOLOS BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO MAKE A BID FOR ZAYRE
THE FAMILY'S PERSONAL WEALTH IS ESTIMATED AT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY ARRANGED FINANCING FOR THE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR BIDS FOR ALLIED AND CARTER HAWLEY
THE DEBARTOLOS LOST OUT IN THE BIDDING FOR ALLIED TO CAMPEAU CORPORATION A TORONTO REAL ESTATE FIRM
CARTER HAWLEY AVOIDED A TAKEOVER THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING
NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
ACTION FOR CHILDREN'S TELEVISION IS THE LEAD PARTY IN THE PETITION EVEN THOUGH THE F. C. C. SAID ITS TOUGHER POLICY IS AIMED AT PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM INDECENT FARE
VIOLATING FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISN'T THE WAY TO PROTECT CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY
IT'S LIKE BURNING BOOKS IN A LIBRARY SAID PEGGY CHARREN PRESIDENT OF THE CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS BASED ORGANIZATION
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION
THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM IN THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COSTS WHO GETS LESS
DOCTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY AND THEIR INCOMES
HOSPITALS ARE FIGHTING TO HANG ONTO REVENUE MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH COMES FROM MEDICARE
AND PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE SERVICES DECREASE
BUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW CONSUMES ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE AND ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TAMING
ANALYSTS SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THE I. P. O.S ON ONE MARKET MIGHT OUTPERFORM THOSE ON ANOTHER OVER A PARTICULAR PERIOD
FOR ONE THING SMALLER STOCKS HAVE OUTPERFORMED LARGER ISSUES FOR MUCH OF THE SPAN COVERED IN N. A. S. D.'S STATISTICS
SO THAT PROBABLY HELPED THE NEW ISSUES ON THE O. T. C. MARKET WHICH ARE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN THOSE HEADED FOR THE BIG BOARD
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOME GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES C. I. A. HAD TO GIVE UP FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
NOW IT IS SUGGESTED THAT OFFICIALS GIVE UP FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS
IN NINETEEN NINETY SOMEONE IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GIVE UP THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTING THEM FROM UNLAWFUL SEARCHES
WHY NOT
THEY MAY BE HIDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THEIR HOMES
A LOS ANGELES BANKRUPTCY COURT MONDAY APPROVED ARGO'S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS INTEREST IN ARGO'S OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SENECA SAID IT WILL REFINANCE SOME OF THE ARGO DEBT
IN ADDITION SENECA SAID IT AND THE SUCCESSOR CORPORATION TO ARGO WILL ENTER INTO A JOINT VENTURE TO EXPLORE AND FURTHER DEVELOP THE ARGO PROPERTIES IT IS ACQUIRING
PACIFIC POWER AND LIGHT IS THE PRINCIPAL UNIT OF PORTLAND OREGON BASED PACIFICORP
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE UTILITY UNIT SAID IN OUR MINDS THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF PREFERENCE WAS LAID TO REST BY THE COURT'S DECISION
THE COMPANY SAID IT EXPECTS TO PREVAIL WHEN THE COMMISSION WEIGHS THE OTHER SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS
THIS IS A VICTORY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ASSERTED THE SPOKESMAN ADDING THAT THE DAM PROVIDES OUR LOWEST COST SOURCE OF POWER
SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS
THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE
TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICK UP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO GET THESE POLICY CHANGES WITHOUT THE CHAOS OF A DECLINING MARKET SAYS HARVARD ECONOMIST LAWRENCE SUMMERS
BUT IF THE MARKET GETS PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ANYWAY IT MIGHT HELP
TO BE SURE THE STOCK CRASH DOES RAISE THE RISK OF RECESSION
THE BENEFITS MENTIONED ABOVE WILL BE OVERWHELMED IF CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES ARE BADLY SHAKEN AND DECIDE TO SHARPLY REDUCE THEIR SPENDING
AN UNUSUALLY WEAK CHRISTMAS BUYING SEASON OR WIDESPREAD SHELVING OF BUSINESS INVESTMENT PLANS COULD EASILY CAUSE THE MARKET'S PROBLEMS TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY
WHETHER THAT HAPPENS DEPENDS FAR MORE ON PSYCHOLOGY THAN ECONOMICS
WE EMPHATICALLY REJECT THE IDEA THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SUBVERTED THE LAW UNDERMINED THE CONSTITUTION OR THREATENED DEMOCRACY
THE PRESIDENT IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH OF AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE AS IS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
IN FACT HE AND THE VICE PRESIDENT ARE THE ONLY OFFICIALS ELECTED BY THE WHOLE NATION
STANLEY NABI EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF BESSEMER SAID THEY'RE NOT REDUCING THEIR OFFER IF YOU CALCULATE THE OFFER'S VALUE AS OF THURSDAY'S CLOSE
I FIGURE IT WAS WORTH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON THURSDAY
WITH FRIDAY'S REVISION IT'S WORTH SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
THE REVISED TERMS ARE NO LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL TERMS IN THE POST CRASH MARKET
<NOISE> BUT SCALI MCCABE WON'T BE EARNING COMMISSIONS FROM THE PURCHASE OF MEDIA SPOTS FOR KIDS R. US
MEDIA PLACEMENT FOR THE UNIT LIKE ITS PARENT IS DONE BY OTHER FIRMS
SCALI MCCABE WILL INSTEAD BE PAID ON A NEGOTIATED FEE BASIS FOR CREATING THE ADS
THE FEES WEREN'T DISCLOSED
IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF <NOISE>
AND IT SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER
MR. BRODY WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
I THINK MR.
TSAI IS PROBABLY TORN BETWEEN TWO GOALS BUILDING A WORLD CLASS FINANCIAL COMPANY AND MAKING MONEY PERSONALLY SAYS MARTIN SOSNOFF OF *ATALANTA* SOSNOFF CAPITAL
WHILE THE GOALS AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE HE ADDS THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ATTAINABLE AT THE SAME TIME
S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
I WAS SHOCKED SAYS MR. KUHLENSCHMIDT
I SAID THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE
I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY STARTED SELLING TIES IN SIZES
BUT I LOOKED AND THERE WASN'T A SIZE ON IT
MR. KINNEAR CONCEDES THAT TEXACO IS BEING BATTERED BY ITS PENNZOIL DIFFICULTIES
LEGAL EXPENSES ARE MONSTROUS
FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY IS REDUCED TO THE POINT WHERE TEXACO CAN'T FIX A MAJOR WEAKNESS DWINDLING OIL RESERVES
THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GOING AND ENDURES INCREASED BORROWING COSTS MR. KINNEAR SAYS
MAJOR BANKS THAT ONCE WERE EAGER TO DO BUSINESS NOW AREN'T
TO RAISE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR INSTANCE THE STOCK OF SOME SUBSIDIARIES HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO BANKS
BUT IF TEXACO SPENDS THAT MONEY BANK LIENS AUTOMATICALLY WILL BE PLACED ON SOME TEXACO ASSETS SAYS RICHARD BRINKMAN CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
<NOISE> WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON
BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS
THE TREASURY RULES HOWEVER CONTAIN MODIFICATIONS OF THE S. E. C. RULES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE PROTECTION OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
IN SUCH AGREEMENTS CALLED REPOS ONE PARTY SELLS GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TO ANOTHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SELLER WILL REPURCHASE THEM LATER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE
THE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS WOULD APPLY TO GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKERS OR DEALERS THAT ARE ALREADY REGISTERED AS WELL AS TO NEWLY REGISTERED ENTITIES
I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
WITH LESS REGULATORY AND POLITICAL PRESSURE CONRAIL WAS ABLE TO ABANDON ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF TRACK BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
ABOUT HALF OF THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY SHORT LINE RAILROADS NONUNION RAILROADS THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AT A LESSER COST
THEY BRING THE BUSINESS TO US AND WE HANDLE IT AS A TRUNK LINE
THE MERGER RESULTS IN SEVERAL CLIENT CONFLICTS
PANASONIC COMPANY A BATES CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BACKER HANDLES MAGNAVOX MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID
INDUSTRY SOURCES SAY EACH ACCOUNT BILLS CLOSE TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS
ALSO HELENE CURTIS LIMITED A BACKER CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BATES HANDLES CARTER WALLACE INCORPORATED MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID
HELENE CURTIS BILLS ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS EQUAL TO ABOUT HALF OF CARTER WALLACE'S BILLINGS ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES
<NOISE> PRESIDENT HUSSEIN'S DOMESTIC STRATEGY AIMED AT SAVING HIS OWN SKIN HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI WANTS IRAQIS TO GIVE HIM MR. HUSSEIN'S HEAD AND END THE WAR
HOWEVER MR. HUSSEIN HAS THUS FAR CONVINCED HIS PEOPLE AND FELLOW LEADERS THAT HIS AND HIS NATION'S FATE ARE THE SAME
ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT COMPUTERIZED TRADING MAY BE AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK SOME INVESTORS FEAR
I'D LOVE FOR ALL THIS STUFF TO JUST GO AWAY
BUT IT'S LIKE NUCLEAR ENERGY SAYS JOHN B. CARROLL THE VICE PRESIDENT OF G. T. E. CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT UNIT
IT'S THERE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY
THE TECHNOLOGY NOW EXISTS FOREVER
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA

THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE
THIS HASN'T BEEN A GOOD YEAR FOR SUNDSTRAND
THE ROCKFORD ILLINOIS AEROSPACE CONTRACTOR EXPECTS TO PAY OUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DISPUTE
IT IS FORECASTING LOWER EARNINGS
AN UPJOHN SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY PLANNED TO MARKET ROGAINE TO WOMEN ALL ALONG
HOWEVER F. D. A. APPROVAL FOR USING THE DRUG ON MEN CAME FIRST BECAUSE UPJOHN DIDN'T TEST THE PRODUCT ON ENOUGH WOMEN INITIALLY
UPJOHN SAID IT BEGAN TESTING ROGAINE ON WOMEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ABOUT FOUR YEARS AFTER TESTS ON BALDING MEN BEGAN
MR. KATO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HIS COMPANY'S SHARE PURCHASE PLAN
*MITSUBISHI* SUBSIDIZES ITS EMPLOYEES WHO BUY THE COMPANY'S SHARES BY PAYING TEN PERCENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE
HE FIGURES THAT HE GETS A MUCH BETTER RETURN THAT WAY THAN BY PUTTING MONEY IN THE BANK
HE IS CREDITED WITH DRILLING THE PRESIDENTS OF TRUST COMPANY'S EIGHTEEN GEORGIA BANKS ON THOSE FUNDAMENTALS SETTING AMBITIOUS PROFIT TARGETS AND HOLDING THE BANKS STRICTLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR REACHING THEM
NOW SUN'S TWENTY SIX FLORIDA BANKS GET THE SAME TREATMENT FROM MR. WILLIAMS
THERE'S A LOT OF AUTONOMY BUT YOU'VE GOT TO EARN IT SAYS THOMAS S. CLARK THE MARKETING DIRECTOR AT SUN'S POLK COUNTY BANK
JUST WHAT SHUWA HAS IN MIND ISN'T CLEAR
A SPOKESMAN IN THE UNITED STATES SAYS THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE SALES OF UNITED STATES PROPERTIES BOTH SHUWA'S AND THOSE OWNED BY OTHERS
SHUWA SAYS IT ISN'T AIMING TO SELL TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS BUT TO INSTITUTIONS AND LARGE INVESTORS
STILL THE SALES OFFICE IS UNUSUAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS MOREOVER IT WILL BE ON THE GINZA AN ADDRESS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SHOPPING
THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION ADDITIONAL
AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION TO THE CONTRAS
MR. JUNGER PREVIOUSLY HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING AND HAS SAID HE ISN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURRENCY LOSS
HE WAS SUMMARILY DISMISSED BY THE COMPANY WHEN THE CURRENCY LOSS CAME TO LIGHT ENDING HIS SEVERANCE CONTRACT THAT WAS TO RUN UNTIL SEPTEMBER
HE RESIGNED FROM V. W. IN JANUARY OVER DIFFERENCES ON HOW THE AUTO MAKER'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE RUN
<NOISE> AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
TORONTO BASED P. C. L. MAKES PACKAGING AND FURNITURE
ROBERT J. TWEEDY ITS PRESIDENT SAID THE COMPANY IS LOOKING AT ITS OPTIONS BUT HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER
MR. TWEEDY AND THOMAS N. DAVIDSON CHAIRMAN OWN NINETEEN PERCENT OF P. C. L.'S FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
AS PRESIDENT TO A LARGE EXTENT I'LL BE DOING MUCH OF WHAT I DID BEFORE
THE COMPANY'S GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUELED BY ACQUISITIONS
THERE ARE MANY AREAS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND IN THE SKILL CATEGORIES THAT WE LACK HE SAID
HE SAID AREAS HE HOPES TO FILL IN INCLUDE A FINANCIAL PUBLIC RELATIONS COMPANY IN NEW YORK AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE MIDWEST
I CURRENTLY HAVE TWENTY SIX CONVERSATIONS IN PROGRESS ALTHOUGH I CAN'T GUESS HOW MANY WILL PAN OUT HE SAID
HOWEVER NET LOSSES IN EURODOLLAR BOND PRICES WERE ESTIMATED AT ONLY ONE EIGHTH TO THREE EIGHTHS POINT BY TRADERS
THE BENCHMARK CANADIAN NINE PERCENT BONDS DUE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WERE BID THIRTY BASIS POINTS LOWER
THE EURODOLLAR BOND MARKET STILL HAS A LOT OF UNDERLYING STRENGTH SAID A SENIOR TRADER FOR ONE EUROPEAN BANK
BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE L- RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
WE SEEM TO BE READY TO TAKE A LITTLE REST SAID ONE PARTICIPANT
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE EITHER SCREAMINGLY WORRIED OR SCREAMINGLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS MARKET SAID ANOTHER
I THINK THE ATTITUDE HAS GOT TO BE THAT WE'VE BEEN OUTPERFORMING THE OTHER WORLD MARKETS AND NOW THE OTHER MARKETS MAY BE OUTPERFORMING THIS ONE A LITTLE
NEW CAMPAIGN CO CHAIRMAN LAXALT MAY SERVE AS *INTERMEDIARY* WITH THE REAGANS EVEN AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUSH STILL FEELS AWKWARD TALKING TO THEM
SOME STRATEGISTS THINK REAGAN'S RECENT RASH OF PATENTLY PARTISAN MOVES HAS BEEN A MISTAKE
ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF *DUBERSTEIN* EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INTEGRATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
MR. TAYLOR WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT A POST HE HAS HELD SINCE MAY FIRST
HE ALSO HAS SERVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER THAT POSITION WILL BE ELIMINATED NEXT TUESDAY
PREVIOUSLY HE WAS PRESIDENT OF CIGNA'S PROPERTY CASUALTY GROUP FOR FIVE YEARS AND SERVED AS CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
THE OPERATION WAS A PIRATE
THEY HAD OPENED WITHOUT OUR BLESSING SAYS ROBERT EARL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OPERATIONS
WE BROUGHT IN OUR DISCIPLINE AND NOW IT'S DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL
MR. EARL NOTES THAT THE HARD ROCK IN TOKYO HAS A LARGE KING KONG FIGURE ON THE SIDE OF ITS BUILDING AND DRAWS MOSTLY AMERICANS

FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A SHARE AFTER TAXES
IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR KODAK SAYS ALEX
BROWN *ANALYST* OTIS BRADLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
IT REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE
BUT THERE APPEAR TO BE SOME MAJOR CATCHES
MANY BANKS THAT CUT RATES HAVE SMALL NUMBERS OF CARDS OUTSTANDING
IN OTHER CASES LOWER RATES ARE AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE MOST CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS
AND CERTAIN RATE REDUCTIONS ARE BEING OFFSET BY HIGHER ANNUAL FEES AND ELIMINATION OF INTEREST FREE GRACE PERIODS
NOW THE TWO UNITS ARE FOR SALE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE HALF THEIR PEAK VALUES OF THREE YEARS AGO
I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP THEM HE SAYS
THE TAX LAWS HAVE CHANGED OUT FROM UNDER ME
MERRILL LYNCH PAID ONE HELL OF A PRICE IN TIME AND CAPITAL TO MOVE INTO INVESTMENT BANKING SAYS HUTTON'S MR. *RITTEREISER* WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR MERRILL

ASSETS OF A HUNDRED AND THREE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FELL FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION TO SIXTY SIX POINT ONE THREE BILLION
DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
YEAH SAID MR. *IACOCCA*
MAYBE
MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. *IACOCCA* WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS
EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE SIGNED A NEW FOUR YEAR CONTRACT WITH CHYS- CHRYSLER
AND IN TUESDAY'S INTERVIEW MR. *IACOCCA* MAINTAINED THAT HE WANTS TO LEAD <NOISE> THE COMPANY INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES

HENRY *KANEGSBERG* AN OFFICIAL OF THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY UNIT CITED COMMUNITY FERVOR AS A BIG REASON

<NOISE> FORD'S FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION UP FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION A YEAR EARLIER
FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION
THAT LARGE JUMP ENABLED FORD TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE UNITED STATES NEW CAR MARKET TO TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT FROM EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
THE COMPANIES SAID THEIR STRENGTHS ARE COMPLEMENTARY
VAN KASPER CONCENTRATES ON GROWTH COMPANIES AND BIRR WILSON FOCUSES ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES
THE COMBINED OPERATION WILL SERVE MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS
FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ELECTION HE PUT INTO EFFECT THE SOCIALIST PROGRAM OF FAST REFLATION AND WHOLESALE NATIONALIZATION

MR. MEESE ANNOUNCED THAT THE DIVERSION WAS UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS
THE CORRECT FIGURE TURNED OUT TO BE ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THIS WAS A COMPARATIVELY SMALL MISTAKE
THE BIG PROBLEM WAS THAT IN ITS HASTE TO RUSH THE STORY OUT THE WHITE HOUSE NEVER THOUGHT THROUGH ITS OWN POLITICAL LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION <NOISE>
OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION HAD MADE MISTAKES AND NOW HAD TO GET THE STORY OUT
<NOISE> BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO ROLL OVER
FOLLOWING THE BASIC LINE WORKED OUT AT THE WHITE HOUSE MR. MEESE USED THE NEWS CONFERENCE TO PORTRAY OLLIE NORTH AS RASPUTIN <NOISE> TO A HAPLESS PRESIDENT

ASSET ALLOCATION TENDS TO INVOLVE INVESTING AGAINST THE TREND
IF ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE A FORCE FOR STABILITY
THE REPORT DOESN'T PREDICT ANY IMMINENT CRASH
<NOISE> INDEED ITS DETAILED ANALYSIS CITES SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS
SOLID USER DEMAND GENERATED BY HONG KONG'S ROBUST ECONOMY AND RISING INCOMES IS ONE FACTOR
ANOTHER IS HEAVY INVESTMENT INFLOWS FROM JAPAN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND TAIWAN
FOR THE MOST PART THE LONDON BANKS SET UP BY JAPANESE SECURITIES HOUSES AND THE SECURITIES COMPANIES SET UP BY JAPANESE BANKS ARE SMALL BY WORLD STANDARDS
NOMURA BANK HAS ASSETS OF ABOUT TWO BILLION YEN THREE POINT FOUR TWO BILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> JAPANESE BANKS' SECURITIES SUBSIDIARIES TYPICALLY HAVE ASSETS OF BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YEN ACCORDING TO A BANK OF ENGLAND SURVEY
THE INITIAL UGLINESS WILL BE OVERWHELMED BY THE FORCE OF NEW IDEAS AND A SYNTHESIS OF OLD ONES
HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WILL EVALUATE WHAT THEY SEE THERE
THEY WILL BEGIN TO QUESTION AND TO READ AND TO THINK
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT WILL HAPPEN THOUGH IN THE CASE OF MR. DOWNEY'S SHOW IT REQUIRES PHILOSOPHICAL TENACITY
<NOISE> BROWNING FERRIS HAS HAD ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES
IT TOOK THE COMPANY MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS TO ACQUIRE PERMITS FOR A WASTE FACILITY NOW BEING BUILT IN RURAL COLORADO

<NOISE> I DON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC FORMULA
<NOISE> BUT HE SAID HE WILL ATTEND SOME LA- LOCAL MEETINGS WHERE RESIDENTS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSS ISSUING PERMITS
I THINK I CAN SET A TONE FOR HOW OUR EMPLOYEES RELATE TO CASH ISSUES HE SAID
MR. ICAHN WANTS TO GIVE HOLDERS A MIXTURE OF TWENTY DOLLARS A SHARE IN CASH AND ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A SHARE FACE AMOUNT OF DEBENTURES

<NOISE> BOSTON AND SIMILAR MARKETS ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE THOUGH
GENERALLY ECONOMISTS PREDICT THAT HOME PRICES NATIONWIDE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL RISE AT THE MOST ONLY A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS FASTER THAN INFLATION <NOISE>
<NOISE> AND IN SOME DEPRESSED REGIONS HOMES ARE ACTUALLY DEPRECIATING
IN WATERLOO IOWA A FARM EQUIPMENT FACTORY TOWN HOME SELLERS ARE COMPETING WITH BANKS STRUGGLING TO UNLOAD HOMES THEY'VE REPOSSESSED
PRICES AROUND HERE ARE WHERE THEY WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SAYS NANCY ERICKSON A REAL ESTATE AGENT

LAST APRIL THE CUSTOMS SERVICE SAID THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SETTLE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF U. S. IMPORT RESTRICTIONS
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WHO BELIEVE <NOISE> THE OFFER INVOLVED THE ISSUES IN THE CIVIL SUIT SAID THE PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED AND THE DISPUTE REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MR. DEAVER NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE COMPANY <NOISE> ADDING THAT HE WASN'T INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AGENCY BEFORE THE COURT ACTION
WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD <NOISE> AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE FROM THE LIENS

<NOISE> A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND AN APPEALS COURT BOTH IN RICHMOND UPHELD THE PLAN
BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THE APPEALS COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION IN LIGHT OF ANOTHER HIGH COURT RULING
LAST JULY THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST
<NOISE> PAST SOCIETAL BIAS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BASIS TO JUSTIFY THE PLAN THE APPEALS COURT SAID IN AN OPINION WRITTEN BY JUDGE J. HARVIE WILKINSON THE THIRD
THE PUZZLE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IS THAT THEIR PROCESS DOESN'T WINNOW VERY FAST
THEY BEGAN WITH EIGHT CANDIDATES
THEY STILL HAVE FIVE
<NOISE> A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

<NOISE> MR. ROGERS COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
THERE ARE TOO MANY CASES WHERE CUSTOMS OFFICERS HAVE GIVEN THEIR OPINION THE CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS
THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE SERVICE
BUT IT IS ALSO THE FAULT OF BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON THIS SORT OF INFORMAL ADVICE
THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN *PRODUCT* IN THE UNITED STATES IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PREMARIN BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORPORATION'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF PREMARIN LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

BUT THE TRADE FIGURES COULD BE AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON INTEREST RATES MANY ANALYSTS SAY
IF THE JANUARY DEFICIT TURNS OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GAP THAT MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE DOLLAR MIGHT RESUME ITS FALL
<NOISE> THAT COULD ALARM FOREIGN INVESTORS AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM ADDING TO THEIR HOLDINGS OF DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS

<NOISE> WE ARE AWARE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILLINGLY ACCEPT THEM THE BANKER OBSERVES
BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WE ALREADY HAVE A PERMISSIVE POLICY HE SAYS
<NOISE> BEHIND THE CHAIRMANSHIP SPECULATION IS A GREATER DEBATE ABOUT MR. JOHNSON
IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY PEOPLE ARE LABELED BY THEIR TRAINING
ROGER SMITH IS AS G. M.'S TOP EXECUTIVE TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN A FINANCE GUY
SOME CRITICS SAY THAT THIS IS EMBLEMATIC OF THE AUTO MAKER'S PROBLEMS AND THAT A PRODUCT GUY SHOULD RUN THE COMPANY

MERRILL LYNCH PAID ONE HELL OF A PRICE IN TIME AND CAPITAL TO MOVE INTO INVESTMENT BANKING SAYS HUTTON'S MR. RITTEREISER WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR MERRILL

EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST
EVENTUALLY AND THE MARKETS SEEM TO BE SAYING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE

<NOISE> INDUSTRIELLE ASSETS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND MINORITY INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TWO BILLION FRANCS
THIS IS A YEAR END PHENOMENON CAUSED MOSTLY BY GERMAN *AUSTERITY* ONE FRENCH OFFICIAL SAID
THE MARK HAS BEEN STRONG AGAINST MOST EUROPEAN CURRENCIES NOT JUST AGAINST THE FRANC
WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THINGS WILL SETTLE DOWN DURING THE NEW YEAR
WE DON'T SEE ANY NEED FOR A REALIGNMENT
ISRAEL'S SHAMIR HOPES TO AVOID LOOKING LIKE A SPOILER OF PEACE PROSPECTS BY FLOATING A REGIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE PLAN INVOLVING ONLY ISRAEL AND ARAB STATES
HE BILLS IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RIVAL *PERES'S* PLAN FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING LEADING TO ISRAEL JORDAN TALKS
BUT JORDAN AND THE PALESTINIANS BOTH FIND SHAMIR'S PLAN UNACCEPTABLE
*MR.* ADELMAN SAYS THAT CLEARLY SERVES MOSCOW
ARMS CONTROL SERVES THE SOVIETS MORE THAN IT SERVES US BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORAL EQUIVALENTS HE SAYS
JUST THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE THEY CAN GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY FAVOR PEACE
HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
GEMFIBROZIL HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO INCREASE H. D. L. BUT UNTIL THIS REPORT ITS EFFECT ON HEART DISEASE WAS UNCLEAR
AVAILABLE IN THE U. S. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO GEMFIBROZIL GAINED ONLY LIMITED USE

LICKING AND STICKING MAY SOON BE OUTMODED IF ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS TAKE HOLD
SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING THE CONCEPT AT FRANK'S SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT USING A MAGNETIC CARD

INTERESTINGLY EN- ENOUGH SOME DEMOCRATS ARE WARMING TO THE IDEA
*PRIVATIZATION* OFTEN IS SIMPLY A GOOD MANAGEMENT SENSE
IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS JUST THE *IDEOLOGICAL* ARGUMENT SAYS DAVID *LINOWES* A DEMOCRAT WHO CHAIRS PRESIDENT REAGAN'S COMMISSION ON *PRIVATIZATION* WHICH ISSUES ITS REPORT NEXT MONTH
ADDS DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS ECKART OF OHIO WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES AND BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE SERVICES
THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN DROP DEAD BUT I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE
SOME DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT MAY GET SOME OF HIS *PRIVATIZATION* INITIATIVES ENACTED BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE
THEY CLASSIFIED EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY AS RACIST OR SEXIST SAYS MR. SCHAUB
WHERE'S THE FREEDOM OF *INQUIRY*
BEATS US
BUT IF YOU FIND A COLLEGE ADMINISTRATOR WHO ISN'T COWERING FROM THE NEW ORTHODOXY LET US KNOW
AMONG ITS REASONS PROVIGO'S BOARD CITED THE FACT THAT *UNIGESCO* AND EMPIRE ARE ALREADY PROVIGO'S MAIN SHAREHOLDERS AND SAID THE OFFER WON'T CHANGE THEIR EFFECTIVE CONTROL
PROVIGO ALSO SAID HOLDERS WHO DON'T ACCEPT THE OFFER STILL WILL BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET
<NOISE> THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT WHETHER OR NOT A HOLDER ACCEPTS THE OFFER IS A PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISION
THE TOTAL CUT WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT OF COFFEE SOLD AND NOT EXCEED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BAGS
ONE BAG EQUALS SIXTY KILOS
THE ANNUAL GLOBAL EXPORT QUOTA IS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION BAGS
ANALYSTS SAY THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE THAT KAO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLIER U. S. ACQUISITION
LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORPORATION FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
HIGH POINT PRODUCES RAW MATERIALS FOR TOILETRIES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
<NOISE> IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
<NOISE> AND MR. BUSH PLEDGES TO MOVE FORWARD ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO HIM IN RECENT YEARS A PACT *ELIMINATING* CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
IT ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY BECAUSE OF VERIFICATION PROBLEMS MR. BUSH SAYS
BUT THAT REALLY IS A PASSION OF MINE
THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE <NOISE> LESS VOLATILE
FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON A SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
THE INVESTORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD SAID PAUL BERNSTEIN AN ATTORNEY FOR ONE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS
HE SAID THE ALLEGED OMISSIONS MAKES THE PROSPECTUS MISLEADING
THE SUITS SEEK DAMAGES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OFFERING PRICE AND THE MARKET PRICE WHEN THE SUITS WERE FILED
THE LATEST RESULTS INDICATE THE TOLL THAT DECLINING HOSPITAL USE IS TAKING ON HUMANA EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY HAS MOVED TO CUT COSTS
<NOISE> A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE LENGTH OF STAY BY HOSPITAL PATIENTS WASN'T ENOUGH TO FULLY OFFSET A FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT DECLINE IN ADMISSIONS
PATIENT DAYS OR THE TOTAL DAYS SPENT BY PATIENTS IN HUMANA HOSPITALS FELL THREE POINT FOUR PERCENT
G. M.'S PROFIT PLUNGED SEVENTY PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER PARTLY FROM THE COST OF PLANT CLOSINGS AND OTHER EFFICIENCY MOVES

IN ADDITION G. E. WILL TAKE CONTROL OF KIDDER'S BOARD SHRINKING IT TO TWENTY ONE MEMBERS FROM TWENTY THREE AND REMOVING NINE KIDDER EXECUTIVES INCLUDING MR. ROCHE
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MR. ROCHE ALL ABOVE NAMED OFFICERS BECAME DIRECTORS
G. E. ALSO NAMED THE FOLLOWING *KIDDER* DIRECTORS
ANY GOVERNMENT BAILOUT POSES SEVERAL RISKS
ONE IS <NOISE> THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY UPSET THE INDUSTRY'S COMPETITIVE BALANCE
<NOISE> WHILE BIG UNIONIZED STEELMAKERS ARE STUMBLING MINIMILLS SMALL PLANTS THAT MAKE STEEL FROM SCRAP INSTEAD OF IRON ORE ARE FLOURISHING
BY RESCUING THE BIG STEELMAKERS SOME ECONOMISTS SAY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD *IMPLICITLY* SAY IT'S WRONG FOR MARKET FORCES TO WORK
WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
<NOISE> OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS ON IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN SOME KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT TO WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
IN SHORT THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE *AYATOLLAH* WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
IN INTERVIEWS AND SPEECHES MR. ROH HAS SHOWN A GOOD GRASP OF THE ISSUES KOREA'S NEXT PRESIDENT FACES
HE TAKES NORTH KOREA FOR THE SERIOUS THREAT THAT IT IS
NATIONAL SECURITY IS A BIG CONCERN FOR SOUTH KOREANS AND IF THEY THINK MR. ROH CAN BEST PROVIDE IT THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM
MR. ROH ALSO FAVORS A FREER ECONOMY TO KEEP SOUTH KOREAN DEVELOPMENT ROLLING
<NOISE> NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
MARCH TYPICALLY BENEFITS FROM SEASONAL FACTORS THAT *BOOST* U. S. EXPORTS
AND IMPORTS OF OIL AND AUTOS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOWER FURTHER HELPING LIGHTEN THE TRADE IMBALANCE
MANY ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THE UNDERLYING TREND CONTINUES TO CALL FOR GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT
BUT THE BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK MAY BE THE MANAGERS THEMSELVES
MANY OF THEM CAN'T HANDLE CRITICISM FROM SUBORDINATES
IN FACT EVEN PROPONENTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY MANAGERS WHO RECEIVE APPRAISALS JUST SHOVE THE RESULTS IN A DRAWER
THE TWO LABORATORIES THAT NICHOLS PURCHASED ARE IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA AND *SIOUX* CITY IOWA
INITIAL PAYMENTS FOR THE LABS TOTALED ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION IN CASH AND PREFERRED STOCK
ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO *BE* MADE OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD HAVE A CURRENT VALUE OF SIX POINT ONE MILLION NICHOLS SAID
THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE *CONTINGENT* UPON CERTAIN MATERIAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS OF THE TWO LABS REMAINING INTACT FOR THREE YEARS NICHOLS SAID
DAVID *MEISTER* F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
<NOISE> WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS A HALF DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. *MEISTER* SAID
HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
NONE OF THIS MEANS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT
<NOISE> CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A L- STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP
THERE MAY BE A GROWING JAPANESE SELF CONFIDENCE IN JAPAN BUT THERE ARE RELATIVELY F:EW JAPANESE ENTREPRENEURS
THERE MAY BE SCA:DS OF MONEY IN JAPAN BUT THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL
SOCIALIST REVOLUTION THE CARDS READ
<NOISE> THE STUDENTS FLASH A COLORFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE KOREAN FLAG
AND THEN IN A PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED MOVE LONG LIVE THE GREAT LEADER KIM IL SUNG
MR. WEBSTER WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO DISMISS ALLEGATIONS THAT LIEUTENANT COLONEL NORTH OR OTHERS MAY HAVE DESTROYED IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS BEFORE INVESTIGATORS SECURED THEM

EXCO A UNIT OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS P. L. C. IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BROKERS OF INTERBANK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSITS
UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT H:OLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
HOURLY COMPENSATION AT *NONFINANCIAL* FIRMS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF THREE PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS BUT FELL ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION
SECOND QUARTER HOURLY COMPENSATION ROSE AT AN ANNUAL NOMINAL RATE OF TWO POINT SIX PERCENT <NOISE> BUT FELL TWO POINT TWO PERCENT ON AN INFLATION ADJUSTED BASIS
UNIT LABOR COSTS INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT YEARLY RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AFTER A TWO PERCENT RATE OF GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER

THE AVID JOGGER EVERY MORNING AT SIX A. M. A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER ONCE A WEEK COME CLOSE TO CONCEDING INTELLECTUAL FAILINGS
KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT

WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S I- INTEGRITY
HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS
WE'LL TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE JUST WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
THE POLITICAL OBSTACLES TO REFORM ARE FORMIDABLE
AUSTERITY IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE WORD ESPECIALLY FOR POLITICIANS
BUT THOUGH REFORM IS ESSENTIAL IF THE DEBTOR COUNTRIES ARE TO HAVE AN ECONOMIC FUTURE
A LARGE PART OF THE *THIRD* *WORLD* DEBT IN VENEZUELA IT WAS NINETY PERCENT WENT TO FINANCE CAPITAL FLIGHT
UNTIL THE COUNTRIES CAN PERSUADE THEIR OWN CITIZENS TO INVEST AT HOME NEW CAPITAL FROM ABROAD ISN'T LIKELY TO RUSH IN OR ULTIMATELY TO BE VERY USEFUL
PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
THE INJUNCTION HAD BEEN SOUGHT BY JOHNSON AND SWANSON A DALLAS LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS TWELVE COMPANIES IN THE FEDERAL COURT PROCEEDING WHERE SEVERAL CASES ARE CONSOLIDATED
CARL TAYLOR AN ATTORNEY IN THE FIRM'S WASHINGTON OFFICE ESTIMATED THAT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY COMPANIES ARE PROTECTED BY THE INJUNCTION
THE COURT ORDER DOESN'T AFFECT HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE CHALLENGING THE TAX IN STATE COURT BUT AREN'T INVOLVED IN THE FEDERAL CASE
GETTING THE DEAL RIGHT IS THE KEY
UNLIKE WARRANTS ON THE JAPANESE STOCK DEALS FOR U. S. COMPANIES AREN'T REALLY COVERED BY THE OWNERSHIP OF UNDERLYING SHARES
INSTEAD UNDERWRITERS USE WHAT THEY CALL A DYNAMIC HEDGE
EACH IS DIFFERENT BUT USUALLY INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF STOCK OPTION PURCHASES ARRANGED BY THE HOME OFFICE IN NEW YORK
CHICAGO CENTRAL AND PACIFIC IS ONE OF THE SLEW OF NEW RAILROADS THAT ARE CREATED AS MAJOR RAILROADS SELL LIGHTLY USED TRACKS
MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY OF THEM HAVE BEEN FORMED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY COMPARED WITH FORTY SEVEN DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION SAYS
MOST ARE SHORT LINES WITH FEWER THAN HUNDRED MILES AND SOME ARE MUCH LONGER REGIONAL LINES OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILES

NONE OF HIS GUESTS HAD SHOWN UP
BONDS SURGED AS INVESTORS REACTED ENTHUSIASTICALLY TO THE TREASURY'S NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BOND AUCTION <NOISE>

BY REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTS AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTERS GIVE THE BUYER AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOP ACROSS A BROADER LINE OF SUPPLIERS
HE SEES THE DAY WHEN AUTO MAKERS' COMPUTERS WILL SCAN THE COMPUTERS OF THEIR PRIMARY SUPPLIERS AND AUTOMATICALLY PLACE ORDERS WITH THE ONE OFFERING THE LOWEST PRICE
MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAMES HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW
PEOPLE THINK THAT A. IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
MUCH OF THE OPTIMISM FUELED WESTERN FINANCIAL FLOWS TO THE SOVIETS IS A R- REACTION TO MR. GORBACHEV'S GLASNOST
BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL STILL BE IN POWER WHEN THE SOVIETS OWE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS
ANOTHER REFORM MINDED LEADER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV TRIED TO KICK START THE SOVIET ECONOMY I- IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AND WAS SENT PACKING
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT FOLLOWED

MR. LI'S CAUTION MAY BE PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR CHINA AT PRESENT DIPLOMATS IN BEIJING SAID
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SPECTACULAR GROWTH CHINA'S ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING

INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS HAVE TRADED ACTIVELY THIS WEEK TRADERS SAID
SOME MONEY MANAGERS ARE PURSUING UNDERVALUED STOCKS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY ISSUES WHILE OTHERS MAY BE STANDING ASIDE OR SELLING
THE RESULT HAS BEEN HEAVY VOLUME A LARGE AMOUNT OF BLOCK TRADING AND NARROW SPREADS BETWEEN BUYING AND SELLING PRICES

ESTIMATES ARE THAT NON FARM PAYROLLS ROSE ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND LAST MONTH AND THAT THE CIVILIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS UNCHANGED AT FIVE POINT THREE PERCENT
<NOISE> OUR PROBLEM IS GETTING THIS VERY VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY WORK SAYS ANTHONY SIMONDS GOODING <NOISE> BRITISH SATELLITE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
BY ACTUALLY OWNING STORES BEN FRANKLIN CAN MORE EASILY EXPERIMENT WITH MARKETING AND INV- INVENTORY PROGRAMS AND OFFER RESULTS TO ITS FRANCHISE OWNERS

WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
A SIMPLER WAY TO REDUCE BANK DEBTS THAT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO BORROWERS ARE STRAIGHT BUY BACKS IN THE GROWING SECONDARY LOAN MARKET

BUT WHEN L. B. O. COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM L. B. O.S ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
MR. DAVIDOFF COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
HIS LAWYER PAUL ROONEY SAID MR.
DAVIDOFF DEEPLY REGRETS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOESKY COMPANY'S FAILURE TO REMAIN AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S NET CAPITAL RULES
MR. ROONEY EMPHASIZED THAT MR. DAVIDOFF WASN'T CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING
WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CAPITAL RULE CARRIES A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE
IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER IS TO HAVE THE NEW PARENT INCORPORATED IN PENNSYLVANIA RATHER THAN OHIO
THE COMPANY SAID IT FAVORS CERTAIN CHANGES IN PENNSYLVANIA LAW REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS THE LIABILITY OF CORPORATE DIRECTORS
THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY JULY THIRTY FIRST
CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
YESTERDAY MINET HOLDINGS P. L. C. SAID ITS PLANNED TEN POINT FIVE MILLION POUND CONTRIBUTION COULD RISE TO TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION POUNDS
LLOYD'S DECLINED TO SPECULATE ABOUT HOW MUCH ITS CONTRIBUTION MIGHT INCREASE
AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
BIDS TOTALING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT SIX EIGHT PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
CITICORP SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
IN EXPORT LED ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER MAKERS KYOCERA SLIPPED NINETY TO FIVE THOUSAND TWENTY
MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL WAS UNCHANGED AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY
N. E. C. ROSE TEN TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TEN
SONY ROSE TWENTY TO FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY
HOWEVER PROFIT FROM FOREIGN TIRE OPERATIONS INCREASED THE COMPANY SAID
SOUTH AMERICAN TIRE OPERATING PROFIT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER SALES AND BETTER MARGINS FIRESTONE SAID MORE THAN OFFSETTING A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EUROPE
ALSO FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS JUMPED TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE COMPANY SAID
EVEN MODEST RETRENCHMENT WOULD MARK A STARK CONTRAST FROM FIDELITY'S HEADY GROWTH OF RECENT YEARS
AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE GROUP EMPLOYED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE AND HAD ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OF AROUND TWENTY THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS
WITHIN FOUR YEARS STAFFING GREW FOURFOLD
ASSETS SWELLED TO AROUND EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS JUST BEFORE LAST OCTOBER'S CRASH
STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
<NOISE> AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
MR. BROOKS'S ARTICLE AWAKENED MEMORIES OF MY TIME AS MR. HOOK'S STUDENT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S WASHINGTON SQUARE COLLEGE SOME TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
ONE OF MR. HOOK'S MOST REMARKABLE PARABLES STILL STAYS FRESH IN MY MIND
HE TOLD OF AN OLD MAN DYING IN THE SPRINGTIME WHO CALLED HIS SONS TO HIS BEDSIDE
MY TREASURE HE SAID IS BURIED SOMEWHERE ON THIS FARM
YOU HAVE ONLY TO DIG TO FIND IT
HE DIED AND THE SONS WENT FOR THEIR SHOVELS
SURE ENOUGH THAT AUTUMN THEY FOUND AND SHARED THE TREASURE
THIS WAS SIDNEY HOOK'S PARALLEL FOR THE ADVANTAGES OF DEMOCRACY
S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE
THE IRAN CONTRA PANEL'S BIG SCENE GOT OFF WITH A BANG YESTERDAY
LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
HE ACCUSED THE COMMITTEE OF WORKING HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THREATENING TO INDICT HIS CLIENT AND USING DIRTY TRICKS BESIDES
GROSSMAN'S INCORPORATED AN OPERATOR OF HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES SAID IT IS OFFERING ELEVEN MILLION COMMON SHARES ON A BEST EFFORT BASIS AT EIGHT DOLLARS EACH
GROSSMAN'S CLOSED AT EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS UP THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF CENTS IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING YESTERDAY
GROSSMAN'S PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO BUY ITS THIRTEEN PERCENT AND FOURTEEN PERCENT DEBENTURES THE *COMPANY* SAID
OF THE TOTAL STOCK OFFERING ABOUT SIX POINT ONE MILLION SHARES ARE BEING OFFERED BY THE BRAINTREE MASSACHUSETTS BASED COMPANY AND THE REST BY HOLDERS
SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INCORPORATED IS THE SELLING AGENT
THE IRAN CONTRA COMMITTEE ENDED ITS HEARINGS YESTERDAY IN A TORRENT OF MEMBERS' SPEECHES ABOUT LIES AND DECEIT
CONGRESS NOW TURNS TO ITS REWRITE OF THE GRAMM RUDMAN LAW WHICH HAD TARGETED THE FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DEFICIT AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
THE TARGET WILL BE RAISED BECAUSE MEMBERS IT SEEMS ARE NOT PREPARED TO KEEP THE SPENDING CUT PROMISES MADE WHEN IT WAS SET
PETROLEUM HELICOPTERS INCORPORATED SAID IT PLANS TO OFFER TWO POINT SIX MILLION TO THREE MILLION SHARES OF ITS NONVOTING COMMON STOCK BEFORE YEAR END
THE PROVIDER OF HELICOPTER SERVICES FOR COMPANIES ENGAGED IN OFFSHORE OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION SAID PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REDUCE LONG TERM DEBT
THE NEW ORLEANS COMPANY WOULDN'T IDENTIFY THE UNDERWRITERS
ANALYSTS SAID THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RUMORED FOR SOME TIME
HOWEVER THEY SAID IT WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING GIVEN THAT SAVANNAH ELECTRIC RECENTLY SAID IT WAS CONSIDERING FORMING A HOLDING COMPANY IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY
A SAVANNAH ELECTRIC SPOKESMAN SAID THE ACQUISITION BY SOUTHERN WILL ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE SAME RESULTS IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER
ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION A FIRST BOSTON SPOKESMAN SAID OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMPEAU HAS NOT CHANGED
WE ARE CAMPEAU'S BANKER OF RECORD
OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH BOB CAMPEAU FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS
BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL
THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST
BEAUTY PAGEANTS ARE RARE HERE HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENT STILL FIXES PRICES ON MANY PRODUCTS AND STRICTLY REGULATES STORE HOURS
AFTER HIS ORIENTATION MR. BOESKY WILL BE ASSIGNED A REGULAR JOB
THOUGH HE CAN STATE A PREFERENCE MR. SAMS SAID MR. BOESKY WILL GO WHERE THE PRISON NEEDS HIM
HE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE MOST DESIRABLE JOBS ARE SNAPPED UP BY INMATES WITH MORE SENIORITY
THE DESIRABLE JOBS MR. SAMS SAID ARE AT THE PRISON'S FACTORY WHICH MAKES WOODEN FURNITURE FOR FEDERAL OFFICES THE DAIRY FARM AND THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT WOULD AFFECT EMPLOYERS WITH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES BUT WOULD EXEMPT FALTERING COMPANIES WORKING TO AVERT A CLOSING
IT WOULD REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO GIVE WORKERS BACK PAY FOR EACH DAY OF NOTICE NOT GIVEN TO A MAXIMUM OF SIXTY DAYS' WAGES
FOR PURPOSES OF COUNTING EMPLOYEES AN AMENDMENT APPROVED YESTERDAY WOULD REQUIRE THAT ONLY WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED FOR SIX MONTHS BE INCLUDED
MR. POPEJOY SAID HE HASN'T HAD ANY REAL MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF BASS GROUP ABOUT REMAINING AT AMERICAN SAVINGS
HOWEVER HE ADDED I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE BASS PEOPLE
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO GOOD THINGS WITH AMERICAN SAVINGS AND THEY WILL MAKE THIS COMPANY PROBABLY THE STRONGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN THE COUNTRY
BUT THEY'VE MADE NO COMMITMENT TO ME NOR I TO THEM
BUT MR. MCCONNELL IN RESPONSE SAID HE BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY
IN HIS EXPERIENCE OWNERS DO REGISTER UNITS EVEN IF THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL PRECISELY TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT
THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE RENT BOARD WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF HOUSING HE SAID
EVERYBODY ELSE IN TOWN WILL TELL YOU OTHERWISE
STOCK PRICES TUMBLED AS INVESTORS BRACED FOR TOMORROW'S TRIPLE WITCHING HOUR
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSED DOWN SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT FIVE POINTS AT NINETEEN EIGHTEEN POINT THREE ONE
MEANWHILE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES SURGED AS BANKS SCRAMBLED TO BORROW FUNDS TO MEET SEASONAL NEEDS
THE SPOKESMAN SAID XEROX IS STILL NEGOTIATING WITH PERSONAL COMPUTER SUPPLIERS ON AN AGREEMENT TO REPLACE THE ONE WITH OLIVETTI THAT EXPIRED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR
WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF OPTIONS INCLUDING A RENEWED AGREEMENT WITH OLIVETTI HE SAID
TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SALES HAVE BEEN SLOWER THAN EXPECTED HE ADDED THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH INVENTORY TO LAST THROUGH ANY PERIOD OF TIME
FURTHER CRITICISM CAME FROM DANTE DE OLIVEIRA WHO RESIGNED AS MINISTER FOR LAND REFORM IN PROTEST AT THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO INSIST ON A FIVE YEAR TERM
HE AND MANY ASSEMBLYMEN BELIEVE A DECISION ON THE LENGTH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL MANDATE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ELECTED LAST NOVEMBER
PRESIDENT SARNEY CAME TO POWER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE FOR A SIX YEAR TERM UNDER AN ACCORD REACHED WITH THE FORMER MILITARY GOVERNMENT
WHAT THIS SHOW REALLY IS THEN IS AN HOMAGE TO THE LATE SPANISH MASTER
IF ONE ACCEPTS THE SHOW ON THAT BASIS IT IS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE ITS GAPS
IN FACT THE GREATER WEIGHT GIVEN MIRO'S EARLIER PAINTINGS WORKS TO ADVANTAGE HERE FOR MANY OF HIS BEST PICTURES WERE DONE BEFORE THE MID NINETEEN THIRTIES
AFTER THAT HIS WORK WAS SOMEWHAT UNEVEN
DETAILS OF THE NEW OFFER WEREN'T DISCLOSED
THE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A WAGE FREEZE LOWER WAGES FOR STARTING EMPLOYEES AND OTHER CONCESSIONS REJECTED BY THE UNIONS
THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT EXPIRED DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST
THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A FIVE PERCENT WAGE RAISE IN EACH OF TWO YEARS MORE JOB SECURITY AND GUARANTEES AGAINST SUBCONTRACTING
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HEALTH DOESN'T REMAIN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE
GREYHOUND CORPORATION WHICH INSTITUTED A COMPANYWIDE SMOKING BAN LAST YEAR SAYS IT WON'T CONSIDER EXEMPTING THE NEW CIGARETTE FROM THE BAN UNLESS IT'S PROVED SAFE
AT GREYHOUND WE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS HARMFUL TO EMPLOYEES' HEALTH ON THE PREMISE SAYS JOHN W. TEETS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
NO ONE HAS COME OUT AND SAID THIS IS A HEALTHY CIGARETTE
SEPARATELY PACIFIC LIGHTING COMPLETED THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SALE OF ITS LAND DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIARIES TO TWO INVESTMENT GROUPS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
THE SALE WILL RESULT IN A FOURTH QUARTER GAIN OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY CENTS A SHARE
THE COMPANY EARLIER HAD SAID IT EXPECTED TO POST THE GAIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER
EDGAR S. WOOLARD DU PONT'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER NURTURED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VENTURE
<NOISE> HE SAYS DU PONT IS STILL VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGES HURDLES THAT MUST BE OVERCOME
THE REAL CHALLENGE HE SAYS IS WHETHER PHILIPS DU PONT OPTICAL CAN GET THERE AND STAY AHEAD
WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS THE COMPANY THAT INVENTED THE OVERNIGHT EXPRESS BUSINESS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO STILL DOMINATES IT
FEDERAL EXPRESS COLLECTS MORE THAN HALF THE REVENUE IN WHAT IS NOW MORE THAN A SIX BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
AND AT A TIME WHEN DETERIORATING SERVICE IS A NATIONAL MALADY THIS COMPANY CLAIMS TO DELIVER MORE THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ITS LETTERS AND PACKAGES ON TIME
THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER VEHICLES FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS
MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
THAT IS TWO TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID
JUST BEFORE THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH GLOBAL EQUITIES CRASH HONGKONG BANK ECONOMISTS EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT THE SPECULATION THAT THEN DOMINATED THE LOCAL STOCK MARKET
THEIR PROPERTY REPORT RECALLS THE EQUITIES CRASH AS A REMINDER THAT ASSET VALUES CANNOT DEFY GRAVITY FOR EVER
THIS WARNING NOW REPRESENTS A MINORITY VIEW
MR. RANDOL SAYS THE SHARP UPWARD TREND IN REFINER MARGINS IS UNUSUAL FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVING SEASON
MARGINS HISTORICALLY HAVE PEAKED BY MID YEAR HE SAYS
BUT U. S. GASOLINE STOCKS ARE CLOSE TO AN EIGHT YEAR LOW WHILE DEMAND HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE INDUSTRY'S PHYSICAL ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE UNLEADED FUEL HE SAYS
THE SAME MENTALITY AFFECTED THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURES OF THE STORES MR. GARCIA SAID
HE OWNS THIRTY SEVEN BURGER KINGS IN FLORIDA BUT HE REFUSES TO PUT UP THE BUILDING THAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY BURGER KING
IT LOOKS LIKE A MATCHBOX
IN BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS' REPORT AND THE JOBS DATA THE GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE A HALF DOZEN OTHER SERIES INCLUDING JUNE'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INDEX
THAT INDEX COULD ADD TO RECESSION FEARS IF IT DECLINES AS EXPECTED
A DROP IN THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC FORECASTING TOOL WOULD MARK THE FOURTH DECLINE IN FIVE MONTHS
A RULE OF THUMB AMONG ECONOMISTS HOLDS THAT THREE SUCCESSIVE DECLINES IN THE INDEX SIGNAL RECESSION
A SMALLER MARKET SHARE STILL MEANS SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH WHEN THE ASSET POOL IS VASTLY EXPANDED NOTES GEORGE COLLINS PRESIDENT OF T. ROWE PRICE
NONETHELESS THE FIRM HAS BEEN PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE CONSUMER ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS
RETAIL CLIENTS CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT T. ROWE PRICE
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT RETAIL BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FIRM'S ASSETS
ME AND THE GUY I WAS FISHING WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS
I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY
I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY
COUPLE MINUTES LATER THE EIGHT POUNDER HIT
JUST LUCKY I GUESS
OVER NINE YEARS THE DRAMA HAS PLAYED OUT SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY THAN EITHER SIDE IMAGINED
SOME GOVERNMENT SERVICES HAVE BEEN CUT BUT LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SKILLFUL IN FIGURING OUT NEW WAYS TO RAISE MONEY
COURT RULINGS HAVE GIVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MORE OPPORTUNITY THAN FIRST THOUGHT TO LEVY HIGHER TAXES
AND THE STATE ECONOMY HAS REMAINED ROBUST SIDESTEPPING THE RECESSION THAT HAS CLOBBERED NEARBY ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES AND THE OIL PRODUCING SOUTHWEST
<NOISE> FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SPOKESMAN JOSEPH COYNE SAID YESTERDAY'S ACTION WAS DONE ENTIRELY AT CITICORP'S INITIATIVE
ALTHOUGH FED OFFICIALS WERE ADVISED OF THE BANK'S PLANS IT WAS THEIR OWN JUDGMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESERVE POSITIONS THEY SHOULD MAKE MR. COYNE SAID
WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER BANKS
THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER IS TO HAVE THE NEW PARENT INCORPORATED IN PENNSYLVANIA RATHER THAN OHIO
THE COMPANY SAID IT FAVORS CERTAIN CHANGES IN PENNSYLVANIA LAW REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS THE LIABILITY OF CORPORATE DIRECTORS
THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY JULY THIRTY FIRST
MR. ICAHN COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT INTENTIONS HE MIGHT ULTIMATELY HARBOR TOWARD TENNECO
HIS POSITION IN THE COMPANY IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE ONE OF MORE THAN TWENTY SIMILAR STAKES HE HAS AMASSED IN A VARIETY OF CONCERNS
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED HE ALSO CONTROLS AN ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT STAKE IN U. S. X. CORPORATION A PITTSBURGH BASED OIL AND STEEL CONCERN
THE ADDED INVESTMENT COMES AT A TIME OF CONTINUING RED INK AT THE TELEVISION VENTURE AND AMID WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT NEWS CORP. WAS PLANNING TO REDUCE ITS INVESTMENT
IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE THIRTIETH SATELLITE TELEVISION POSTED A PRETAX LOSS OF FIVE POINT SIX NINE MILLION POUNDS ON REVENUE OF EIGHT MILLION POUNDS THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NEWS INTERNATIONAL MAY CUT ITS STAKE SHE SAID
CHASE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THE SALE OF ITS COMPUTER SERVICES COMPANY INTERACTIVE DATA CORP. AND OFFICES IN PARIS
AMONG OTHER ASSETS CHASE IS CONSIDERING FOR SALE ONE NEW YORK PLAZA A LOWER MANHATTAN OFFICE BUILDING
BIDS ON THAT ARE DUE IN MID APRIL
BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN DEMOCRAT FROM OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC
THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS
SENATOR COHEN ALSO SAID H- HE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U. S. SOVIET DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
MR. ABANTO BRIEFLY SUCCEEDED IN RAISING GOLDMAN'S PROFILE AMONG THE TOP FIVE U. S. UNDERWRITERS OF CORPORATE BONDS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
BUT SINCE THEN THE FIRM HAS TRAILED ITS MAIN RIVALS
LEAGUE TABLES AREN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO US SAID MR. RUBIN
THE FIRM THAT'S NUMBER FIVE OR NUMBER SIX CAN BE JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS THE FIRM THAT'S NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO
<NOISE> THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX FELL SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE POINTS TO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE POINT FOUR
VOLUME WAS A LIGHT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX WAS OFF NINETEEN POINT SIX AT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT EIGHT
THE DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE OPERATOR SAID THE CHANGE WILL REFLECT A WRITE DOWN OF FIXED ASSETS INVENTORY DISPOSAL AND SEVERANCE PAY IN RELATION TO THE STORE CLOSING
THE STORE WHICH HAS ABOUT FORTY EMPLOYEES WILL CLOSE IN EARLY JANUARY
THE COMPANY SAID DUE TO THE STORE'S ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE AND THE LEVEL OF SALES VOLUME IT HAS DEVELOPED THE STORE HAS NOT BEEN PROFITABLE
INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS HAVE TRADED ACTIVELY THIS WEEK TRADERS SAID
<NOISE> SOME MONEY MANAGERS ARE PURSUING UNDERVALUED STOCKS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY ISSUES WHILE OTHERS MAY BE STANDING ASIDE OR SELLING
THE RESULT HAS BEEN HEAVY VOLUME A LARGE AMOUNT OF BLOCK TRADING AND NARROW SPREADS BETWEEN BUYING AND SELLING PRICES
TODAY'S EMPLOYMENT REPORT FOR JULY COULD LAUNCH ANOTHER DAY OF HEAVY TRADING IF IT CONTAINS EVIDENCE OF A SHARP SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH
ESTIMATES ARE THAT NON FARM PAYROLLS ROSE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND LAST MONTH AND THAT THE CIVILIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS UNCHANGED AT FIVE POINT THREE PERCENT
AMONG THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DID MESSRS.
BOESKY OR STEINBERG RECEIVE INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET MERGER TALKS
DID THEIR LARGE POTENTIALLY UNFRIENDLY POSITIONS IN HARRIS ENCOURAGE HARRIS OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE A SALE
WERE THEY WORKING TOGETHER SEPARATELY OR IN CONCERT WITH DREXEL OFFICIALS TO BRING ABOUT A SALE OF HARRIS
VISITS TO BOTH COUNTRIES HOWEVER LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LONG
FOR DEBT IN BRAZIL AS IN MEXICO IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION
THE OTHER IS FINDING THE RESOURCES AND THE WILL TO OVERCOME A MIRE OF POVERTY AND IGNORANCE
AND IN BOTH COUNTRIES THIS MIRE COULD ULTIMATELY PROVE POLITICALLY EXPLOSIVE
U. S. LAWMAKERS WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO ISRAEL ARE EXPECTED TO REACT TO THE REPORT BY PUBLICLY PRAISING ISRAEL FOR ITS RECENT STEPS
HOWEVER THESE LEGISLATORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
ALSO SINCE MILITARY CONTRACTS BETWEEN JERUSALEM AND PRETORIA ARE SECRET AND IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER THE PACTS CONTAIN RENEWAL CLAUSES IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MONITOR ISRAELI COMPLIANCE
THERE ARE CLEAR LIMITS TO GLASNOST
SOME RELAXATION OF CONTROLS OVER RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IS EVIDENT BUT NOT MUCH
RADIO LIBERTY QUOTES A GORBACHEV SPEECH TO UZBEK PARTY LEADERS WARNING AGAINST PARTICIPATION BY PARTY MEMBERS IN RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES
HE DOES NOT TAKE A BENIGN VIEW OF THE RISE OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM ALONG SOVIET BORDERS
IT'S UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THE TARGET COMPANY WILL SET A PATTERN SETTLEMENT BECAUSE FORD IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN G. M.
ONE INDICATION THAT PATTERN BARGAINING MAY BE BREAKING DOWN IS THE WIDE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AUTO MAKERS' INITIAL PROPOSALS
IN THE PAST BOTH COMPANIES HAVE PRESENTED VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL OFFERS ON THE SAME DAY
MR. KAPLAN JOINED MACMILLAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY WHEN A COMPANY HE CO FOUNDED THE FREE PRESS WAS SOLD TO THE PUBLISHER
HE BECAME PRESIDENT OF MACMILLAN PUBLISHING IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND WAS NAMED MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY'S BRITISH SUBSIDIARY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR
HE REASSUMED THE POST OF PRESIDENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
WE'RE VERY KEEN ON BRITAIN RIGHT NOW SAYS MICHAEL PEERS CHAIRMAN OF IVY INTERNATIONAL FUND IN HINGHAM MASSACHUSETTS
BRITAIN MR. PEERS SAYS IS INCHING AWAY FROM HEAVILY UNIONIZED RUST BELT INDUSTRIES TOWARD SERVICE ORIENTED BUSINESSES
WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ECONOMIC RENAISSANCE IN THE U. K. HE SAYS
ON THE N. F. L. FRONT PLAYERS CONTINUED TO RETURN TO THEIR TEAMS
SO FAR HOWEVER ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE UNION'S FIFTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MEMBERS HAVE DECIDED TO RETURN FOR THIS WEEK'S GAMES
FANS WERE ALSO RETURNING THEIR TICKETS
N. F. L. TEAMS REPORTED THOUSANDS OF REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS AND SAID THEY EXPECTED THOUSANDS MORE
A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
<NOISE> NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE
IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF
AND IT SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER
MR. BRODY WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
MR. MORELAND WHO IS NOW WORKING THROUGH A COMPANY CALLED CONTINENTAL TRADING INTERNATIONAL L. T. D. COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
CONTINENTAL'S ATTORNEY JAMES BARBER AND MICHAEL GABRIEL AN ATTORNEY FOR MR. MORELAND VIGOROUSLY DENY ANY FRAUD ON THE PART OF CONTINENTAL OR MORELAND INDUSTRIES
SAYS MR. GABRIEL WE WOULD LOVE TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN COURT WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE TO TRY TO PROVE THAT RIDICULOUS CHARGE
JAMES MAHONEY MR. CARSON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THE SPLIT WITH MR. BUSHKIN OCCURRED AFTER MR. CARSON DECIDED TO SELL HIS TELEVISION PRODUCTION BUSINESS
THERE AREN'T ANY FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES HE SAYS
THEY *DIFFERED* ON THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS COMPANIES WERE BEING SOLD
MR. CARSON IS SAID TO HAVE DECIDED TO SELL CARSON PRODUCTIONS PIECEMEAL INSTEAD OF AS A GOING CONCERN
MR. BUSHKIN REPORTEDLY FAVORED KEEPING THE COMPANY WHOLE RATHER THAN AUCTIONING INDIVIDUAL ASSETS
BURGER KING U. S. A. PILLSBURY'S BIGGEST SINGLE BUSINESS ALSO REMAINS ITS LARGEST PROBLEM
DESPITE A MANAGEMENT SHAKE UP AND AN EXPENSIVE NEW ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN FRANCHISEES REPORT DISAPPOINTING SALES
LET'S JUST SAY IT'S NOT A ROARING SUCCESS SAID ONE WEST COAST FRANCHISEE OF THE WE DO IT LIKE YOU'D DO IT PROMOTIONAL THEME
A SUCCESSFUL AD CAMPAIGN WILL DRIVE SALES AND WE DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING
A PILLSBURY SPOKESMAN SAID BURGER KING SALES IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER HAVE BEEN FLAT
MANY OFFICERS AT THE MARINES COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE IN QUANTICO VIRGINIA PRIVATELY EXPRESSED CHAGRIN TO A RECENT VISITOR
THEY FEEL THE UNFOLDING NORTH SAGA FEEDS A STEREOTYPE OF MARINES AS HEADSTRONG AND GIVEN TO MACHISMO BUT NOT MUCH ON INTELLIGENCE OR JUDGMENT
OLLIE IS TERRIFIC FOR THE MOVIES SAYS ONE YOUNG OFFICER BUT HE'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE CORPS
BUT JACK CORBETT THE GROUP'S INTERIM PRESIDENT SAYS THE ORGANIZATION PREFERS HAVING POLICY DIRECTORS WITH EXPERTISE IN AVIATION
THE DUES HE SAYS ENTITLE MEMBERS TO SEVERAL TRAVEL ASSISTANCE SERVICES SUCH AS A HOTLINE FOR HELPING FIND LOST LUGGAGE
THE GROUP ALSO WILL LOBBY FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN AIRLINE SERVICE
WE THINK OUR BACKGROUND WILL HELP US COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS HE SAYS
MR. ADELMAN SAYS THAT CLEARLY SERVES MOSCOW
ARMS CONTROL SERVES THE SOVIETS MORE THAN IT SERVES US BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORAL EQUIVALENTS HE SAYS
JUST THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE THEY CAN GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY FAVOR PEACE
HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
TATE AND LYLE'S FINANCE DIRECTOR JAMES KERR MUIR SAYS THE STAKE WAS SOLD BECAUSE WE HAD NO FURTHER COMMERCIAL VALUE FOR THE SHARES
WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BID AGAIN AND WE WERE HAPPY WITH THE PRICE WE ACHIEVED
TATE AND LYLE PAID AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY PENCE A SHARE FOR ITS STAKE
FERRUZZI EARLIER SOLD ITS TWENTY THREE POINT SEVEN PERCENT STAKE IN BERISFORD TO ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS P. L. C.
MR. BOWMAN SAID HE SENT A LETTER TO DAYTON HUDSON OFFICIALS QUESTIONING THEIR REJECTION OF THE DART GROUP BID
I'D CHARACTERIZE US AS UPSET HE SAID
I WOULDN'T BE DOING MY FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY IF I DIDN'T ASK THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON
IMPLIED IN THE PIECE WAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED ABOUT SENATOR KENNEDY'S BEHAVIOR IN THE HEARINGS
I DID POLL ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO JUDGE BORK AND A FIFTY SIX PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT MAJORITY THOUGHT THE COMMITTEE HAD BEEN FAIR
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT AFTER THE CHAPPAQUIDDICK EPISODE OUR POLL FOR TIME MAGAZINE WAS WIDELY VIEWED AS THE MOST BLUNT AND UNSPARING OF SENATOR KENNEDY
NON U. S. BORROWERS ALSO REPORTEDLY MAY COME TO MARKET
THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA MAY LAUNCH A LONG DATED EUROYEN ISSUE PERHAPS TOTALING EIGHTY BILLION YEN SIX HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS
JAPAN FINANCE CORPORATION FOR MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISES IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE A SEVEN YEAR ISSUE THAT MAY TOTAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EARLY TODAY
THE ACADEMY'S FEARS ABOUT SOLICITING VOTES HOWEVER MAY BE EXAGGERATED
SAYS BOOKER MCCLAY A PUBLICIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN PROMOTING MOVIES FOR OSCARS YOU CAN'T BUY THE VOTERS
THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT AND VERY JADED
ACADEMY MEMBERS HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PICTURES HE ADDS AND YOU CAN'T HUSTLE THEM
THEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HOW CORPORATE DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO ACT
IN BRITAIN DIRECTORS' LEGAL DUTY IS TO SHAREHOLDERS DUTCH LAW OBLIGATES DIRECTORS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCLUDING EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND CREDITORS
DUTCH LAW IS SO HOSTILE TO UNFRIENDLY BIDS THAT NONE HAS SUCCEEDED THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY
THE COST OF INSTALLING SPRINKLER SYSTEMS IS HIGH
ONE LOS ANGELES FIRE OFFICIAL ESTIMATED THAT FULL SYSTEMS COST FROM ONE DOLLAR TO THREE DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT
EACH OF FIRST INTERSTATE'S FLOORS ARE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET
JULY PLATINUM ROSE TEN DOLLARS THIRTY CENTS AN OUNCE FROM FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS
JULY SILVER ADVANCED EIGHT POINT FIVE CENTS AN OUNCE TO SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE FIVE
AUGUST GOLD GAINED ONE DOLLAR TWENTY CENTS AN OUNCE TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS EIGHTY CENTS
ALL THREE METALS TRADED HIGHER AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE DAY BUT LATE PROFIT TAKING TRIMMED THE ADVANCES
BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS CORPORATE BAILOUTS AND RESTRUCTURINGS WERE COMMON
BUT SOME LED TO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION THAT ARE NOW BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE OPPOSITION CONTROLLED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
PRESIDENT ROH TAE WOO'S GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO PROVOKE SIMILAR SUSPICIONS NOR DOES IT WANT TO APPEAR TO BE SHORING UP ANOTHER FAILING COMPANY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE
MR. REISCHAUER AN ECONOMIST ALSO SOUGHT TO MAKE A MORAL ISSUE OF THE DEFICIT
IT'S UNSEEMLY TO HAVE THE RICHEST NATION OF THE WORLD DRAWING THE RESOURCES OF THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SUPPORT CONSUMPTION HE SAID
INSTEAD OF LENDING MONEY TO THE U. S. HE SAID THAT WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN SHOULD BE INVESTING IT IN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES
MR. WEBSTER WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO DISMISS ALLEGATIONS THAT LIEUTENANT COLONEL NORTH OR OTHERS MAY HAVE DESTROYED IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS BEFORE INVESTIGATORS SECURED THEM
WE HAVE FOUND NO INDICATIONS TO DATE THAT ANY EVIDENCE WAS LOST MR. WEBSTER SAID
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE HAVE FOUND THAT INDICATES WE LOST ANYTHING
WE DO TAKE EXCEPTION HOWEVER TO YOUR EDITORIAL'S COMMENTS ON THE SITUATION
THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION IS NOT CAUSE FOR AN AD HOMINEM ATTACK ON DOCTOR ROBERT TEMPLE ONE OF THE F. D. A.'S LEADING PHYSICIAN SCIENTISTS
DOCTOR TEMPLE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPINION OF AN OUTSIDE ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOR WILL THE DECISION ON T. P. A. BE MADE BY THE OFFICE HE HEADS
HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED TEN POINT SIX POINTS HIGHER AT TWO TWO SEVEN ONE POINT EIGHT

HARRY L. DAVIS WAS NAMED A DIRECTOR OF THIS MINING AND INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT MAKER
MR. DAVIS IS DEPUTY DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S BUSINESS SCHOOL
HE FILLS A VACANCY ON THE BOARD CAUSED BY THE RETIREMENT OF A DIRECTOR EARLIER THIS YEAR
WE SEE MANY OF THOSE WHO BOUGHT WEDNESDAY COMING INTO THE MARKET TO SELL A BROKER SAID YESTERDAY
TRADERS SAID THERE WERE FEW SELL ORDERS FROM INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT BUY ORDERS FROM CORPORATE INVESTORS HAD GROUND TO A HALT

MOST ARAB STATES BROKE OFF RELATIONS WITH EGYPT WHEN THAT COUNTRY SIGNED A PEACE TREATY WITH ISRAEL EIGHT YEARS AGO
OMAN SUDAN AND SOMALIA DIDN'T CUT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT
JORDAN AND DJIBOUTI DID BUT HAVE SINCE RESTORED RELATIONS
FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ELECTION HE PUT INTO EFFECT THE SOCIALIST PROGRAM OF FAST REFLATION AND WHOLESALE NATIONALIZATION
AS INFLATION SOARED AND THE FRANC NOSE DIVED HIS APPROVAL RATING PLUNGED
THEN HE CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY
HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AUSTERITY PROGRAM WAS APPLAUDED BY EVEN HIS RIGHT WING OPPONENTS
AFTER NAMING FOUR COMMUNISTS TO HIS ORIGINAL CABINET HE BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND DESTROYED THEM AS A POLITICAL FORCE
WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
RATES ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS ALSO WERE LITTLE CHANGED
THE RATE ON THE LATEST THREE MONTH BILL FELL TO FIVE POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT BID FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN TWO PERCENT WEDNESDAY
BUT THE RATE ON THE LATEST SIX MONTH BILL CLIMBED TO SIX POINT OH FOUR PERCENT BID FROM SIX POINT OH THREE PERCENT
THE BILL WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE ENACTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALSO WOULD PREVENT STATES FROM SETTING OTHER CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
BANKERS HAD SOUGHT THAT TO AVOID HAVING TO MEET A PLETHORA OF DIFFERING DISCLOSURE STANDARDS
WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRE EMPTION SAID BARBARA MUNSON MANAGER OF CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS FOR THE CONSUMER BANKERS ASSOCIATION A TRADE GROUP
THEY LIKE MANY DEALERS BLAME V. W.'S DECLINE ON MR. PHILLIPS AND HIS LOW PROFILE STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
BUT JACK PRICE AN ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO V. W. DEALER SAID MR. PHILLIPS'S CALM APPROACH HELPED LEAD THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS DIFFICULT TIMES
HIS DEFENDERS ALSO NOTED THAT MANY EUROPEAN AUTO MAKERS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE U. S. RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE DECLINING VALUE OF THE DOLLAR
MR. PHILLIPS WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON HIS JOB CHANGE YESTERDAY COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID
IN PHILIPS SUN HAS WON A EUROPEAN ALLY THAT IT HOPES WILL PROVIDE AN EDGE OVER COMPETITORS
MOTOROLA INCORPORATED M. I. P. S. COMPUTER SYSTEMS INCORPORATED AND HEWLETT PACKARD COMPANY ARE JOCKEYING TO WOO COMPUTER MAKERS TO THEIR OWN R. I. S. C. CHIPS
THE CHIPS ARE RAPIDLY GAINING POPULARITY AMONG COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST CONVERTS COULD BECOME A DE FACTO STANDARD IN TOMORROW'S COMPUTER INDUSTRY
THE COURT HAS ORDERED MR. WARD AND GUINNESS'S FORMER CHAIRMAN ERNEST SAUNDERS TO RETURN THE MONEY
IT ALSO HAS FROZEN AS MUCH AS EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR ASSETS
BUT THE TWO MEN'S LAWYERS ARE ASKING THAT THE ORDER GRANTED TEMPORARILY BE LIFTED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A FULL TRIAL
THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR VERSUS
M. I. T. E. SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE

THERE'S NO MINDLESS ATTEMPT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAX PRIVATE CORPORATIONS OUT OF EXISTENCE HE SAYS
THAT'S SILLY YOU DON'T DO THAT
YOU WANT THEM TO DO WELL
AT FIRST SOME MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT SUCH CORPORATE INITIATIVE
A HOSPITAL OFFICIAL RECALLS THIS ATTITUDE YOU MAKE BEER CANS
DON'T TELL US HOW TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
LAST MONTH HOWEVER THE HOSPITAL STARTED TO DISCOUNT ROOM RATES FOR ALCOA EMPLOYEES
IT ALSO AGREED TO USE MEDISGROUPS AND THEN DISCLOSE CERTAIN CLINICALLY RELATED DATA TO THE COMPANY
AND MANY DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL HAVE AGREED TO CAP THEIR FEES
WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES

THE F. D. P. IS THE ONE PARTY THAT HAS AT LEAST BEEN GRAPPLING SERIOUSLY WITH THE CONCEPT OF SUPPLY SIDE TAX CUTS
THE F. D. P.'S OTTO LAMBSDORFF A FORMER ECONOMICS MINISTER HAS HELPED MOVE THE F. D. P. AHEAD OF THE KOHL STOLTENBERG COMBINE ON THIS ISSUE
IN AN INTERVIEW LAST MONTH MR. LAMBSDORFF CALLED FOR CONSIDERABLE TAX CUTS WHICH HOPEFULLY CAN BEGIN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
IDEALLY MR. LAMBSDORFF WOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARGUE HIS VIEWS INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT
THE MOST RECENT TRIGGER PRICE FOR SUSPENDING QUOTAS ONE POINT FIVE ZERO ZERO EIGHT DOLLARS A POUND WAS EXCEEDED DECEMBER TWELVE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE

THE TREASURY RULES HOWEVER CONTAIN MODIFICATIONS OF THE S. E. C. RULES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE PROTECTION OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
IN SUCH AGREEMENTS CALLED REPOS ONE PARTY SELLS GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TO ANOTHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SELLER *WILL* REPURCHASE THEM LATER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE
THE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS WOULD APPLY TO GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKERS OR DEALERS THAT ARE ALREADY REGISTERED AS WELL AS TO NEWLY REGISTERED ENTITIES
MR. BOTHA !ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING <NOISE>
WE'VE BEEN PONDERING THE SIXTEEN COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT RETURNED AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR DISCONNECTING ODOMETERS ON NEW CARS THAT ITS EMPLOYEES WERE TEST DRIVING
MANY OF THE SOME SIXTY THOUSAND CARS AND TRUCKS WERE DRIVEN FOR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILES
LEE IACOCCA HAS NOW CALLED THIS PRACTICE DUMB AND STUPID
THAT DECISION IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY THE POLITICAL HEAT ON NORWAY'S MINORITY LABOR PARTY GOVERNMENT
LAST WEEK IT PUBLISHED A CRITICAL REPORT ON THE WORK AT MONGSTAD BUT STOPPED SHORT OF CALLING FOR RESIGNATIONS
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THE COST OF REPLACING SENIOR EXECUTIVES WOULD OUTWEIGH THE POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACTION
FOUL WEATHER WAS ALSO BLAMED BY A SPOKESMAN FOR PAN AM THE FIRST PLACE FINISHER IN DECEMBER
WEATHER PARTICULARLY AFFECTED FLIGHTS IN THE NORTHEAST AND EUROPE WHERE MOST OF PAN AM'S ROUTES ARE LOCATED HE SAID
HE ADDED THAT PAN AM NONETHELESS TURNED IN ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES AMONG MAJOR CARRIERS
HE PREDICTED THE NEXT REPORT WILL SHOW A REBOUND FOR THE AIRLINE IN FEBRUARY
THE NEXT OLYMPIC STOP IN SEPTEMBER IS SEOUL AND THERE IS REASON TO DOUBT IT WILL GO AS QUIETLY AS THE CALGARY GAMES
SOUTH KOREA IS IN POLITICAL TURMOIL ITS OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THEY EXPECT TROUBLE FROM THEIR SPARRING PARTNERS TO THE NORTH AND THE U. S. FLEET WILL PATROL OFFSHORE

I GUESS IT'LL BE BETTER TO FEEL LIKE A TOOTHPASTE CARTON THAN TO GET SQUEEZED
MR. EZELL GLANCES OUT HIS OFFICE WINDOW AT OLD GLORY AND THE I. N. S. FLAG SNAPPING IN THE OCEAN BREEZE

BUT IT ALSO AVOIDS MOST OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE P. S. TWO FAMILY
A TOUGHER ANTI NORIEGA POLICY NEED NOT LAUNCH A NEW ROUND OF U. S. MEDDLING ABROAD OR EVEN A GLOBAL ANTI DRUG CRUSADE
MANY GOVERNMENTS INVOLVED IN CRIMES AGAINST AMERICANS WILL ALWAYS REMAIN OUTSIDE AMERICA'S REACH
BUT THE U. S. HAS THE RIGHT AND THE POWER TO STOP GENERAL NORIEGA'S AGGRESSION AGAINST ITS YOUTH AND INNER CITIES
CONTINUING THE CURRENT POLICY OF WAFFLING IS A CONFESSION THAT FOR ALL AMERICA'S SQUAWKING OFFICIAL DRUG TRAFFICKING IS SOMETHING WE CAN LIVE WITH
THE GROUP HERE IN LIBERTY CENTER WAS RECRUITED BY A FARMER WHO PROMISED WORK FOR THREE MONTHS
WITH THE PROMISE NOW MEANINGLESS THE BAND HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE MIGRANT REST CENTER BEYOND THE USUAL THREE DAY LIMIT

THEY CALL HER A SAINT SANTA MARIA
MR. BUSH WAS DISMISSIVE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COMMISSION A BIPARTISAN PANEL THAT IS STUDYING WAYS TO ATTACK THE DEFICIT
MANY BUSINESS AND POLITICAL LEADERS SEE THE COMMISSION AS PROVIDING THE POLITICAL COVER NECESSARY FOR A NEW PRESIDENT TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE DEFICIT PROBLEM
BUT MANY CONSERVATIVES WORRY THAT COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL RECOMMEND A TAX BOOST AS PART OF A DEFICIT CUTTING PACKAGE
IN SUM BOTH THE IMPROVEMENTS IN INCOME TO PERSONS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION BEAR OUT NEITHER THE THESIS OF STAGNATION NOR DECLINE IN INCOME
NOR ANY INCREASED POLARIZATION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
ALTHOUGH SOME CABINET MEMBERS HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN THE MASS ACTION TOOK MANY BY SURPRISE
<NOISE> MR. BENIGNO SAID TALK OF RESIGNING STARTED DURING A CABINET MEETING

KELLNER DILEO STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH ONLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND REPORTEDLY HAS HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL GAINS OF SIXTY PERCENT BEFORE PAYOUTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS
LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
ANALYSTS SAID THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RUMORED FOR SOME TIME
HOWEVER THEY SAID IT WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING GIVEN THAT SAVANNAH ELECTRIC RECENTLY SAID IT WAS CONSIDERING FORMING A HOLDING COMPANY IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY
A SAVANNAH ELECTRIC SPOKESMAN SAID THE ACQUISITION BY SOUTHERN WILL ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE THE SOME OF THE SAME RESULTS IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER
DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR

JUST BEFORE THE OCTOBER NINETEEN GLOBAL EQUITIES CRASH HONGKONG BANK ECONOMISTS EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT THE SPECULATION THAT THEN DOMINATED THE LOCAL STOCK MARKET

WE KNOW THAT THESE THEORETICAL ECONOMIC CONCEPTS DO NOT ALWAYS WORK OUT PERFECTLY IN THE REAL WORLD
ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN PRICES INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS

THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK

THE SYSTEM WAS ABANDONED IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SHORTLY AFTER MR. LEHMAN LEFT OFFICE
OTHER PLANNED FEATURES OF THE OSAKA AIRPORT SUGGEST THAT THE PLANNERS HAVEN'T LEARNED THE LESSONS OF NARITA
THE NEW AIRPORT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED ON A MAN MADE ISLAND IN OSAKA HARBOR

EVEN BEFORE BLACK MONDAY RETAILERS WERE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON
STORE SALES HAD BEEN SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AMID SIGNS THAT THE CONSUMER LED ECONOMIC EXPANSION WAS FALTERING
THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE HADN'T HELPED EITHER AS RETAILERS WHO DEPEND ON GOODS FROM THE FAR EAST HAD TO ABSORB HIGHER COSTS
ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED

CAPITAL CITIES A. B. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TALKS
NEXT YEAR WHEN DEMOCRATS REGAIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE PROSPECTS WILL BE MARKEDLY BETTER THAT CONGRESS ACTUALLY WILL ENACT TRADE LEGISLATION
ALREADY CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE TRADE THEIR TOP PRIORITY
BUT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN OF TEXAS WHO WILL BE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE NEXT YEAR HAS BEEN CALLING FOR A BIPARTISAN APPROACH
THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
MANY AMERICANS REMEMBER WHEN CONGRESS THOUGHT POVERTY WAS CAUSED BY A LACK OF MONEY SO IT PROVIDED MONEY
IT THOUGHT UNEMPLOYMENT WAS CAUSED BY A SHORTAGE OF JOBS SO IT CREATED WORK
CONGRESS THOUGHT HUNGER WAS SOLELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LACK OF FOOD SO IT MADE FOOD FREELY AVAILABLE
BUT EACH PROBLEM PROVED TO BE FAR MORE COMPLICATED THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT
THREE DECADES AND MORE THAN A TRILLION DOLLARS LATER WE ARE SEEMINGLY NO FURTHER ALONG ON THESE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAN WHEN WE STARTED
OR AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE ARE REPEATEDLY TOLD AS CONGRESS REQUESTS MORE MONEY FOR ALL ITS PAST CREATIONS

FINANCIAL SHARES WERE HIT HARDEST AMID FEARS OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES
BOB DOLE AL HAIG AND JACK KEMP HAVE ALL PICKED UP THE IRAN CONTRA CLUB TO USE ON MR. BUSH

LATER THIS YEAR SEARS PLANS TO OPEN SELF CONTAINED APPLIANCE AND HOME SHOPS TO COMPETE WITH WARD
SEARS IS ALSO FOLLOWING WARD'S FORAY INTO SELLING MORE BRANDED MERCHANDISE ESPECIALLY IN APPLIANCES
AND IT IS BRANCHING OUT OF MALLS TO OPEN SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD STORES THAT COULD WHITTLE AWAY WARD'S CUSTOMER BASE
THE SHOCKER WAS THAT THE JUDGE HAD ORDERED A HUGE DAMAGE PAYMENT BEFORE CARBIDE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES IF ANY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AT A TRIAL
AT FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST THE DECISION SEEMS TO VIOLATE ANY *DEFENDANT'S* FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AGAINST IT
A CARBIDE SPOKESMAN HAS DECRIED THE RULING AS A JUDGMENT AND DECREE WITHOUT TRIAL
IT'S A HUNDRED AND SEVEN DEGREES OUTSIDE AND THE LIGHTS IN THE RESTAURANT HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF COOLNESS
CUSTOMERS ENTER WITH SWEAT POURING DOWN THEIR FACES
THEY TAKE DESPERATE GULPS OF WATER AND DIG INTO THE DAILY SPECIAL A CURRY WITH VEGETABLE SIDE DISHES
BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
BEYOND THE BUSH YEAR(S)-

THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS
COMMUNIQUES ANNOUNCING COMPLETION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS WERE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NOVEMBER NINTH NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
<NOISE> THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR
MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE

SO SHE DESIGNED HER OWN CALLED NEARLY ME AND THUS BEGAN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE
BUYING STAMPS THROUGH A COMPUTER NETWORK SIGHT UNSEEN COULD BE HAZARDOUS
THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD *BE* *MADE* PUBLIC
AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
<NOISE> IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
<NOISE> AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
THE DEPRESSION WASN'T JUST ONE LONG SLUMP AS THE POPULAR IMAGE HAS IT BUT A SERIES OF RECOVERIES ABORTED BY FURTHER RECESSIONS
THESE SLUMPS WITHIN THE SLUMP IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WERE BOTH PRECEDED BY LARGE IN:COME TAX INCREASES
THIS FOLLY HAS NOT PASSED UNNOTICED BY KEYNESIANS

MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
THAT IS TWO TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID
WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
UNITED ALSO DISPUTED CONTINENTAL'S ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD OFFER LOWER !FARES
A SPOKESMAN SAID UNITED HAS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO REDUCE FARES TO JAPAN BUT HAS BEEN OPPOSED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH FEARED INCREASED COMPETITION FOR ITS NATIONAL CARRIERS
FARES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE CHANGED ONLY THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENT
<NOISE> THAT NEWS SENT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ON A GIDDY RISE OF MORE THAN FIFTY POINTS

F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION INCREASES ITS CITRUS ACREAGE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND
BECAUSE THE AUTO INDUSTRY'S GOOD TIMES ROLLED ON SO LONG EACH COMPANY ASSUMED THAT WHEN THE CRUNCH CAME THE OTHER GUY WOULD GET HURT
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF HONDA
FOR YEARS WHILE *RIVALS* DANGLED FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATES AND INTEREST FREE LOANS BEFORE BUYERS HONDA STOOD ABOVE IT ALL
IT EFFORTLESSLY SOLD ALL THE CARS IT COULD MAKE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALL IT COULD SHIP FROM JAPAN

ONE NEW DIRECTORATE MEMBER ISN'T LIKELY TO CHANGE BUNDESBANK POLICY
<NOISE> BUT BUNDESBANK WATCHERS EXPECT MR. TIETMEYER TO SIDE WITH MR. POEHL'S MONETARY POLICIES WHICH EMPHASIZE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OVER UNILATERAL ACTIONS
OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE FREQUENTLY CLASHED WITH MR. POEHL OVER HIS EFFORTS TO COORDINATE WEST GERMAN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE MOVES WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS
DOING EVERYTHING PEOPLE WANT THE F. D. A. TO DO WOULD REQUIRE AN F. D. A. THE SIZE OF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT HE SAYS

BUT THAT YEAR THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN ILLINOIS'S LAW AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN A RULING THAT CAST DOUBT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE LAWS OF ALL THIRTY SEVEN STATES
IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT SAINT

THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT

<NOISE> TAX TALK BY JAMES BAKER AND HOWARD BAKER RILES ADMINISTRATION CONSERVATIVES
IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS OFF ON SIGNIFICANT TAXES THERE'LL BE A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING SAYS A WHITE HOUSE AIDE
BUT DESPITE THE RHETORIC ANY TAX BILL ACCEPTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO DO LITTLE TO REDUCE THE RED INK
SEVERE NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE ON TAKEOVERS ALSO APPEAR DOOMED
LINCOLN HAS ABOUT TWO MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
YESTERDAY IN COMPOSITE *TRADING* ON THE AMERICAN S- STOCK EXCHANGE LINCOLN CLOSED AT ELEVEN DOLLARS ONE TWENTY FIVE A SHARE UP TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS

LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
<NOISE> THE TOKYO FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET IS CLOSED ON SATURDAYS
<NOISE> EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS WERE CLOSED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EXCEPT MILAN WHERE PRICES EDGED UP IN FRIDAY'S SESSION
THE MILAN STOCK INDEX CLOSED UP SEVEN LIRE AT TEN SIXTY SIX
THE FED'S POSTURE THROUGH ALL OF THIS IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE WILLIAM MCCHESNEY MARTIN FED OF THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES
THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION ABOUT <*MR.*> MR. MARTIN'S PRIORITIES HE WAS FIRST OF ALL AN INFLATION FIGHTER AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY TO THE GOOD
BUT NO ONE WAS EVER SURE JUST HOW THE FED WOULD WAGE ITS INFLATION BATTLES
MR. MARTIN INDICATED THAT HE WOULD LEAN AGAINST THE WIND WHEN HE SENSED INFLATION COMING AND HE DID
HE GOT RID OF THE INFLATION SURGE THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BUT IT TOOK THE DEEP NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT RECESSION TO DO SO
WITH THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AS ITS PRIME CUSTOMER TRACOR WAS HELPLESS WHEN DEFENSE SPENDING SLOWED
INTERNALLY MR. INMAN SAYS HE DISCOVERED THAT EXPENSES COULDN'T BE CUT AS EASILY AS HAD BANKERS HAD FORECAST
AND FEES WERE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED
MR. INMAN CALLS IT ALL PART OF MY EDUCATION
AT THIS POINT COMPETING DEVELOPERS WERE EYEING THE PROJECT
UNDER ITS GROUND LEASE WITH THE CITY AND STATE THE PARTNERSHIP MIGHT BE FOUND IN DEFAULT ON ITS CONTRACT ENABLING A COMPETING DEVELOPER TO TAKE OVER
TO STAVE OFF AN ATTACK MR. HARRISON SAYS OUR POSITION WAS THAT WE WERE NEVER IN DEFAULT ON OUR LEASE
WE MAINTAIN THAT THE BANK STOPPED FUNDING
STAN WEINSTEIN THE EDITOR OF THE PROFESSIONAL TAPE READER WHICH ALSO RANKED NEAR THE BOTTOM IN THE SURVEY DISAGREES WITH SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MR. HULBERT'S RANKING METHOD
FOR EXAMPLE MR. WEINSTEIN DISLIKES THE WAY MR. HULBERT CALCULATES ENTRY AND EXIT PRICES
HE SAYS MR. HULBERT SHOULD USE PRICES MIDWAY IN MR. WEINSTEIN'S RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR STOCK PURCHASES OR SALES
MR. HULBERT CUSTOMARILY USES MARKET PRICES EITHER THE OPENING PRICE OR THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR THE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE
BY CONTRAST THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNIST NATIONS HAVE FERTILITY MODESTLY ABOVE REPLACEMENT
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES HAVE A T. F. R. OF FOUR POINT ONE
THE U. S. HAD A T. F. R. OF THREE POINT EIGHT IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AT THE PEAK OF THE BABY BOOM
IN ADDITION TO THE STOCK MARKET FACTORS HURTING THE OFFERING THE DECLINING PRICE OF OIL TOOK ITS TOLL
AS THE OFFERING WAS IN ITS PLANNING STAGES IN LATE JULY SPOT CRUDE PRICES APPROACHED TWENTY THREE DOLLARS A BARREL
BUT THEY HAD FALLEN TO ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS WHEN THE PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS WAS PUBLISHED IN EARLY AUGUST AND HAVE MOSTLY HOVERED BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY DOLLARS SINCE THEN

<NOISE> NOW I ONLY GO INTO THE GYM TWICE A WEEK AND IT'S LIKE RECESS THE FAVORITE PART OF MY DAY NOT AN INTRUSION ON MY LIFE
ANOTHER LESSON SHE CAME AWAY WITH IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT IS IRRELEVANT IN TERMS OF EXERCISING
GOOD TECHNIQUE HOLDING THE CONTRACTION THAT'S THE PUREST DEFINITION OF EXERCISE HOW MANY MUSCLE FIBERS CAN YOU EXPLODE
ADMINISTRATORS BLAME THE HIGH COST OF CARE ON SUCH FACTORS AS RISING SALARIES WHICH THEY SAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS SIXTY PERCENT OF EXPENSES
THEY SAY A NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE FORCES THEM TO PAY BONUSES FOR QUALIFIED HELP
BUT EVEN AT THIS PRICE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS

MACHO NONSENSE OF THIS TYPE ABOUT WORLD TRADE IN THE NATION'S HIGHEST DELIBERATIVE BODY HELPS EXPLAIN WHY CONFIDENCE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR HAS NOT BEEN ROCK SOLID OF LATE

U. S. LAWMAKERS WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO ISRAEL ARE EXPECTED TO REACT TO THE REPORT BY PUBLICLY PRAISING ISRAEL FOR ITS RECENT STEPS
<NOISE> HOWEVER THESE LEGISLATORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
ALSO SINCE MILITARY CONTRACTS BETWEEN JERUSALEM AND PRETORIA ARE SECRET AND IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER THE PACTS CONTAIN RENEWAL CLAUSES IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MONITOR ISRAELI COMPLIANCE

LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORPORATION FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
HIGH POINT PRODUCES RAW MATERIALS FOR TOILETRIES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
EARNINGS WEREN'T DISCLOSED <NOISE> BUT DIETER SPETHMANN THE MANAGING BOARD CHAIRMAN CALLED THEM SATISFACTORY
HE REPEATED THOUGH THAT THE GROUP'S STEEL DIVISION WILL POST A LOSS IN THE YEAR ENDING <NOISE> NEXT SEPTEMBER THIRTY
HOWEVER THYSSEN'S SPECIALTY STEEL INDUSTRIAL AND TRADING DIVISIONS ARE EXPECTED TO POST GOOD FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EARNINGS HE ADDED
CATERPILLAR WON'T DISCUSS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE MOVE WHICH THE COMPANY SAYS WAS DONE TO REDUCE LABOR AND P- PARTS COSTS
BUT THE DOLLAR'S TWENTY PERCENT DECLINE AGAINST THE FRENCH FRANC SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE COULD HAVE INFLATED THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION COSTS BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
CATERPILLAR SAYS IT HEDGES AGAINST RISK FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE INTERBANK MARKET HELPING TO EASE THE FALLING DOLLAR'S NEGATIVE IMPACT
EVEN AS IT IS WE'VE LEARNED THAT SEX CAN BE REMOVED FROM PROPAGATION ALL THAT IS NECESSARY IS A LABORATORY WITH PEOPLE IN WHITE COATS
WHAT THAT PORTENDS FOR THE BABY MS. GROWN TO ADULTHOOD NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT WILL THEIR FEELINGS WHEN THEY COME TO KNOW HOW THEY CAME TO BE
WHAT TIES WILL BIND THEM TO A FATHER WHO WAS ONLY A SPERM IN A TEST TUBE OR TO A MOTHER WHO WAS ONLY BRIEFLY A RENTED BODY
TO WHICH ONE IF EITHER DOES THE CHILD BELONG
<NOISE> PROPERTY OWNERS ARE MORE SECURE TODAY THANKS TO THE SUPREME COURT
THIS MONTH IN FIRST ENGLISH EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH OF GLENDALE VERSUS
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THE COURT SAID THAT LANDOWNERS ARE OWNED COMPENSATION WHENEVER GOVERNMENT DEPRIVES THEM O- OF THE USE OF THEIR LAND EVEN TEMPORARILY
THE BIGGEST EFFECT OF THIS RULING MAY NOT BE THAT <NOISE> COMPENSATION WILL BE PAID BUT THAT MANY CONTEMPLATED REGULATIONS WILL NEVER BE IMPOSED AT ALL
DESPITE THE DECLINE IN STOCK PRICES TRADING VOLUME WASN'T OVERWHELMING
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPARED WITH ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION MONDAY
BUT TRADERS ASSERTED THAT MUCH OF THE LATE ACTIVITY CAME FROM PROFESSIONALS
ANTHEM ELECTRONICS INCORPORATED SAID IT SOLD ONE POINT SIX MILLION COMMON SHARES AT THIRTEEN DOLLARS EACH
THE SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA BASED DISTRIBUTOR OF SEMICONDUCTORS AND RELATED SYSTEM SAID THE *OFFERING* BRINGS TOTAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING TO ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION
PROCEEDS WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES ANTHEM SAID INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF BANK LOANS AND POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS

ANTHEM SHARES CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTEEN POINT ONE TWO FIVE DOLLARS UP TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING
THE RIGHT WING UNDERWORLD ISN'T ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE LANDOWNER AS THE ATTACKS ON THE SUMITOMO COMPANIES SUGGEST
A YEAR AGO SUMITOMO REALTY RECEIVED A BOMB THREAT AT ITS TOKYO HEADQUARTERS AND MR. ANDO THE CHAIRMAN FOUND A CARDBOARD BOX BURNING ON HIS DOORSTEP
THIS OCCURRED WHEN ALLEGATIONS SURFACED LINKING FORMER SUMITOMO EXECUTIVES WITH A LOAN SCANDAL INVOLVING A LAND SHARK COMPANY
<NOISE> WITH ONE EAR LAURA SLOATE LISTENS TO A MAN READING HEADLINES FROM SIX NEWSPAPERS
WITH THE OTHER EAR SHE MONITORS AN AIDE READING HER MAIL

CAMPEAU BOOSTED ITS HOSTILE OFFER FOR FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES TO FIVE POINT FOUR SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AMID SIGNS OF A *POSSIBLE* BIDDING WAR FOR THE RETAILER
AT LEAST TWO MAJOR GROUPS ARE WEIGHING BIDS SOURCES SAID INCLUDING A GROUP LED BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS
OTHER POTENTIAL SUITORS ARE SAID TO BE DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES AND DEVELOPER ALFRED TAUBMAN AND MELVIN SIMON
UNITED ALSO DISPUTED CONTINENTAL'S ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD OFFER LOWER FARES
A SPOKESMAN SAID UNITED HAS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO REDUCE FARES TO JAPAN BUT HAS BEEN OPPOSED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH FEARED INCREASED COMPETITION FOR ITS NATIONAL CARRIERS
FARES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE CHANGED ONLY THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENT
THAT'S WHAT WALL COVERING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES DO
LAST WEEKEND AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING HERE NEARLY FIFTY OF THEM DRESSED UP IN FABRICS DESIGNED FOR BEDROOM BATHROOM AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WALLS
THEN AFTER A FEW ROUNDS OF DRINKS THEY STAGED A FASHION SHOW FOR HUNDREDS OF GUESTS
THEY LIKE MANY DEALERS BLAME V. W.'S DECLINE ON MR. PHILLIPS AND HIS LOW PROFILE STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
<NOISE> BUT JACK PRICE AN ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO VOLKSWAGEN DEALER SAID MR. PHILLIPS'S CALM APPROACH HELPED LEAD THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS DIFFICULT TIMES
HIS DEFENDERS ALSO NOTED THAT MANY EUROPEAN AUTO MAKERS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE U. S. RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE DECLINING VALUE OF THE DOLLAR
MR. PHILLIPS WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON HIS JOB CHANGE YESTERDAY COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID
SUCH PLANS MAKE EDUCATORS CRINGE
THEY WORRY THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE COULD BE REDUCED TO A FEW TRIPS TO THE NOTES SUPERMARKET
MY GUESS IS THAT IT WILL QUICKLY BECOME WIDESPREAD BECAUSE OF PEER PRESSURE LAMENTS RANDY KNIGHT VICE CHAIRMAN FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES IN OHIO STATE'S PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
THE COMMUNISTS COULDN'T SOLVE POLAND'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SO THEY NEEDED TO BRING IN SOLIDARITY HE SAYS
IN CHINA TOO THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERS CAN'T OVERCOME OUR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES
THEY WILL NEED OUR HELP
<NOISE> MR. STEINMAN THE BEER NEWSLETTER PUBLISHER ADDS THAT AMERICAN BABY BOOMERS GOT HOOKED ON CORONA BECAUSE THEY CAN PUT LIME JUICE IN IT
THIS SEEMS TO MAKE THEM FEEL LATINO ALTHOUGH A MEXICAN WOULD NO MORE PUT LIME JUICE IN A CORONA THAN A FRENCHMAN WOULD PUT PEANUT BUTTER ON A CROISSANT
MEXICANS ONLY PUT THE JUICE OF A LIME LIKE FRUIT IN CANNED BEER
STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING THAT LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
<NOISE> HALLMARK HOWEVER HAS SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE THESE STATIONS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE FORMAT
THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
TO THESE ENDS K. P. C. ENJOYS A HUGE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
IT COSTS KUWAIT ABOUT A DOLLAR TO PUMP A BARREL OF OIL AND ANOTHER FIFTY CENTS TO BRING IT TO EUROPE
<NOISE> THE PRODUCTION COST OF NORTH SEA OIL BY CONTRAST RUNS BETWEEN EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
THE BIG DIFFERENCE DISTURBS EUROPEAN OIL MEN
NOW THE TWO UNITS ARE FOR SALE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE HALF THEIR PEAK VALUES OF THREE YEARS AGO
<NOISE> I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP THEM HE SAYS
THE TAX LAWS HAVE CHANGED OUT FROM UNDER ME
SUSPICIOUS MERRILL LYNCH CALLED IRWIN L. JACOBS THE MINNEAPOLIS INVESTOR WHOSE VENTURES INCLUDE MINSTAR
MR. JACOBS TOLD THE BROKERAGE THAT THE ORDER WAS A FAKE AND DISMISSED IT AS A PRANK
THE NEXT DAY A SIMILAR WIRE WAS SENT THIS ONE SEEKING TO SELL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF CONTROL DATA
<NOISE> CITIZENS IN STATE CUSTODY HAVE A RIGHT TO SAFE INCARCERATION DECENT LIVING CONDITIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF BETTERMENT
WITHOUT EMPTYING THE PUBLIC PURSE OR JEOPARDIZING THE PUBLIC SAFETY GOOD CORRECTIONAL MANAGEMENT CAN PROVIDE THESE THINGS
<NOISE> IN THE WORDS OF JAMES MADISON IF MEN WERE ANGELS NO GOVERNMENT WOULD BE NECESSARY
BEHIND THE WALLS AND IN THE COMMUNITY GOVERNING CONVICTED CRIMINALS IS A PUBLIC MANAGEMENT TASK THAT WE CAN PERFORM IN A MORE HUMANE AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER
BUT WESTIN HAS SHOWN UNSPECTACULAR ALBEIT STEADY EARNINGS IN RECENT YEARS AS COMPETITION HAS HEATED UP IN THE LUXURY HOTEL MARKET
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IT HAD OPERATING EARNINGS OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN IT H- EARNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
<NOISE> REVENUE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH
RECORDS WERE SET FOR SIX ARTISTS INCLUDING MARC CHAGALL CLAUDE MONET AND PIERRE AUGUSTE RENOIR
THE TOP PRICE WAS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RENOIR PAINTING OF A YOUNG WOMAN
MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
I AM ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
YOU CAN TOO
ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
<NOISE> INEVITABLY SOME WILL SEEK A FOURTH ALTERNATIVE TO CONTINUE BORROWING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKING ONLY MARGINAL ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES
EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST
<NOISE> EVENTUALLY AND THE MARKETS SEEM TO BE SAYING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE
<NOISE> MR. MORELAND COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT BUT ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING HIM HAVE PREVIOUSLY DENIED HE COMMITTED ANY ACTS OF FRAUD
AN ATTORNEY FOR MR. REYNOLDS IN SAN DIEGO SAID WE FEEL OUR CLIENT DID NOTHING IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
<NOISE> JOSEPH A. JOHNSON A GEOLOGIST ALLEGEDLY HIRED BY MR. MORELAND WHO IS ALSO NAMED A DEFENDANT IN THE SUIT SAID HE HADN'T YET BEEN SERVED
<NOISE> THE FACILITY ALSO OUTRAGED MANY BY TAKING A HARD LINE ON THE TYPES OF INJURIES FOR WHICH IT WOULD OFFER SETTLEMENTS
IT REFUSED TO SETTLE CASES FILED BY WORKERS WHOSE LUNGS HAD BEEN SCARRED BY *ASBESTOS* EXPOSURE BUT WHO WEREN'T YET DISABLED
<NOISE> BECAUSE SOME VICTIMS HAD WON COURT AWARDS FOR SUCH INJURIES OTHERS VIEWED THE RULING AS A DECLARATION OF WAR
LAST WEEK HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS SETTLED ON THE HOUSE FINANCING PLAN
BUT WHEN THE HOUSE SENATE COMPROMISE WAS TAKEN UP ON THE HOUSE FLOOR YESTERDAY A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT BUSH WAS WAITING
<NOISE> IF THE CONFERENCE REPORT IS PRESENTED TO ME IN ITS CURRENT FORM HE WROTE I WILL VETO THE BILL
THE EXISTING BENCHMARK THIRTY YEAR BONDS ENDED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS LOWER OR DOWN THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
THE ISSUE'S YIELD WHICH MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM ITS PRICE WAS -U QUOTED LATE AT EIGHT POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT
THE PRICE ON THE LONG TERM BOND WAS QUOTED AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVEN AND THIRTY OVER THIRTY TWO
THE NEW TEN YEAR NOTES WERE QUOTED IN WHEN ISSUED TRADING AT ABOUT NINETY NINE AND FOURTEEN THIRTY SECOND TO YIELD EIGHT POINT OH SIX FIVE PERCENT
PALO VERDE IS OWNED BY SEVEN ELECTRICAL UTILITIES INCLUDING PHOENIX BASED A. Z. P. GROUP INCORPORATED'S ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY
THE PLANT'S SECOND UNIT IS ALREADY SHUT DOWN FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND ISN'T SCHEDULED TO RESUME OPERATIONS UNTIL EARLY MARCH A SPOKESMAN FOR THE OPERATORS SAID
A THIRD PALO VERDE UNIT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
THE ORDER WAS SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AS THE ENTIRE LAWSUIT HAS BEEN
THE APPEALS COURT SAID IT HAD EXPLAINED IN A SEALED OPINION WHY THE SUIT IS RIPE FOR DECISION
IN FACT THE APPEALS COURT ORDER WAS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS BEEN DISCLOSED THAT JUDGE ROBINSON FOUND THE LAWSUIT PREMATURE
DESPITE THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL EXPECTATIONS PRIVATE ECONOMISTS HAD BEEN PREDICTING THAT GROWTH IN THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR WOULD BE BELOW EVEN THE REVISED TARGET
YESTERDAY'S G. N. P. FIGURES WERE WITHIN GENERAL EXPECTATIONS SUSUMU TAKETOMI SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR INDUSTRIAL BANK OF JAPAN L. T. D. SAID
THE BANK HAD PREDICTED GROWTH OF TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT
IF YOU WANT TO BUY BUY A LITTLE
IF YOU WANT TO SELL SELL A LITTLE
BUT MODERATION IS THE KEY MS. SAGER SAID
WE'RE URGING OUR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR PORTFOLIO IN CASH
IDEALLY A CAMPAIGN'S FREE MEDIA AND PAID MEDIA MESH SEAMLESSLY ONE REINFORCING THE OTHER
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RE ELECTION EFFORT MAY HAVE SET A NEW STANDARD IN THIS REGARD
RALLIES WERE METICULOUSLY STAGED TO REINFORCE THE CAMPAIGN'S MESSAGE OF PATRIOTISM AND OPTIMISM
THE RESULT WAS NEWS FOOTAGE THAT LOOKED LIKE THE CAMPAIGN'S COMMERCIALS
TWELVE PHILADELPHIA ANTIQUE DEALERS WERE CHARGED BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WITH ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS
ELEVEN PLEADED GUILTY LAST FALL AND WERE FINED BETWEEN ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND GIVEN PROBATIONARY SENTENCES UP TO THREE YEARS
THE TWELFTH WAS FOUND GUILTY BY A JURY SENTENCED TO THIRTY DAYS OF HOUSE ARREST AND FINED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
AND REVENUES SLUMP
AMSTRAD IS THE LARGEST EUROPEAN SUPPLIER OF HOME COMPUTERS AND A MAJOR VENDOR OF BUSINESS PERSONAL COMPUTERS
IT JOINS MANY PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS WORLD WIDE REPORTING DIFFICULTIES FROM CHIP SHORTAGES
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS MUCH OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY OF DRAM CHIPS HAS BEEN PINCHED PARTLY BY A SEMICONDUCTOR TRADE PACT
I KNOW BUT IT'S CLOSE
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
BEING A LIBERAL IS NOT LIKE BEING A DEMOCRAT
BEING A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN IS LIKE HAVING THE RED PIECES OR THE BLACK PIECES IN A CHECKERS GAME
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORAL IMPLICATIONS
BUT BEING A LIBERAL IS BA:D
YOU CAN BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT IF YOU'RE NOT LIBERAL AND YOU CAN BE A BAD REPUBLICAN IF YOU ARE LIBERAL
S. E. C. CHAIRMAN DAVID RUDER PRESENTED THE *UNANIMOUS* POSITION OF THE FIVE MEMBER COMMISSION AT A MEETING YESTERDAY OF SECURITIES REGULATORS IN MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA
MR. RUDER SAID THAT AN EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR GLOBAL MARKET SHOULD INCLUDE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS FOR DISSEMINATING MARKET DATA ON PRICES AND TRADING VOLUME AND FOR EXECUTING TRADES
HE ADDED THAT ULTIMATELY ALL COUNTRIES SHOULD SET UP AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR CLEARING AND SETTLING EQUITY AND DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND THAT MANY SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD BE LINKED
BUT TROMA WON'T TRY
OUR DESTINY IS A SMALL ONE SAYS MR. KAUFMAN
BUT AT LEAST WE'RE IN CONTROL OF IT
THE COMPANY SELLS COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRIMARILY TO LEGAL OFFICES
COMPUTRAC WILL PAY OUT THREE CENTS IN JULY AND NINE CENTS IN THE FOLLOWING JANUARY
THE FIRST DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE IN JULY TO STOCK OF RECORD JULY FIFTH
COMPUTRAC WILL PAY NINE CENTS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO STOCK OF RECORD JANUARY FIFTH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE *SYMPTOMS* ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
THE FED MAY HAVE EXPECTED US TO DROP THE PLAN GIVEN ITS CONDITIONS SAYS MR. KOMATSU
BUT AT THE END OF THAT LONG DAY HE AND SUMITOMO'S CHAIRMAN ICHIRO ISODA DECIDED TO BET THAT THE TERMS WOULD EVENTUALLY BE RELAXED
THE GLASS STEAGALL ACT SEPARATING COMMERCIAL FROM INVESTMENT BANKING IN THE U. S. GRADUALLY WILL CHANGE OR BE DONE AWAY WITH SAYS MR. KOMATSU
WE FELT THE FUTURE WOULD CERTAINLY BE BRIGHT
OUR POLL REVEALS STRONG SCIENTIFIC BELIEF IN THE SAFETY OF U. S. NUCLEAR PLANTS COMBINED WITH SKEPTICISM THAT A CHERNOBYL STYLE DISASTER COULD HAPPEN HERE
SPECIFICALLY SEVENTY ONE PERCENT RATE A CHERNOBYL STYLE ACCIDENT AS IMPROBABLE OVER FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN PERCENT WHO RATE IT PROBABLE
EVEN MORE EIGHTY TWO PERCENT REGARD U. S. REACTORS AS SAFER THAN THE CHERNOBYL PLANT
IS THAT SAFE ENOUGH
TWO OUT OF THREE SCIENTISTS SIXTY SIX PERCENT SAY THAT NUCLEAR PLANTS HERE ARE CURRENTLY SAFE COMPARED WITH SEVENTEEN PERCENT WHO FIND THEM UNSAFE
JUDGE THEM ON THEIR PERSONALITY JUDGE THEM ON ANYTHING YOU WANT THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES TELLS THE CROWD
THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHREYER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
SOME RETAIL FIRMS ARE SETTLING FOR SECOND
E. F. HUTTON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR INSTANCE WON'T FIGHT FOR ACROSS THE BOARD SUCCESS IN INVESTMENT BANKING ITS CHAIRMAN ROBERT RITTEREISER SAYS
INSTEAD HUTTON WILL SPECIALIZE IN A FEW AREAS WHERE IT HOPES TO BECOME A MAJOR PLAYER
<NOISE> IN THE MILITARY OR IN ANY APPOINTED LEADERSHIP POSITION YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE JOB YOU HOLD HE SAYS
IN POLITICS WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE SEEKING A CLAIM OR APPROBATION YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHOM YOU WOULDN'T TOLERATE FOR THIRTY SECONDS
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO TOLERATE FOOLS
THE RIGHT WING UNDERWORLD ISN'T ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE LANDOWNER AS THE ATTACKS ON THE SUMITOMO COMPANIES SUGGEST
A YEAR AGO SUMITOMO REALTY RECEIVED A BOMB THREAT AT ITS TOKYO HEADQUARTERS AND MR. ANDO THE CHAIRMAN FOUND A CARDBOARD BOX BURNING ON HIS DOORSTEP
THIS OCCURRED WHEN ALLEGATIONS SURFACED LINKING FORMER SUMITOMO EXECUTIVES WITH A LOAN SCANDAL INVOLVING A LAND SHARK COMPANY
MR. LI'S CAUTION MAY BE PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR CHINA AT PRESENT DIPLOMATS IN BEIJING SAID
AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SPECTACULAR GROWTH CHINA'S ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING
PRICES ARE SKYROCKETING CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT AND GRAIN PRODUCTION IS STAGNANT
EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL REFORMERS BELIEVE CHINA'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS SHOULD MOVE IN THE COMING YEAR TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEMS BEFORE FURTHER REFORMS CAN BE INTRODUCED
SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS
-AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
WHEN REMINDED OF THE ROLE REVERSALS IRVING'S MR. RICE SAYS THE FACT THAT THE MERGER TALK NEVER WENT FURTHER OBVIOUSLY SHOWS THERE IS NO COMMONALITY
A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. BACOT SAYS THIS A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN BANKING AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE INTERVENING YEARS
THE *RELEVANCE* OF THOSE COMMENTS TO TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES ISN'T VERY GREAT
MR. FORBES SAID HE'D HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
I ASSURE YOU THAT FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
MR. FORBES ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME <NOISE>
<NOISE> I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
<NOISE> HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
BANCORP HAWAII ALSO DECLARED A THREE FOR TWO STOCK SPLIT PAYABLE NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH TO STOCK OF RECORD OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH
THE STOCK SPLIT WILL INCREASE THE COMPANY'S SHARES OUTSTANDING TO FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION FROM NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION
A COMPANY OFFICIAL SAID THE DOLLAR A SHARE DIVIDEND WILL BE PAID ON SHARES OUTSTANDING PRIOR TO THE STOCK SPLIT
IN JULY MR. TAFT FORTY SIX YEARS OLD WAS NAMED VICE CHAIRMAN AFTER SERVING AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS
THE MOVE WHICH STRIPPED MR. TAFT OF HIS OPERATING DUTIES IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN PUSHED FOR BY THE BASS GROUP
THE GROUP HAS FOUR REPRESENTATIVES ON THE TAFT BOARD AND CONTROLS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF TAFT'S NINE POINT TWO MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
WESTINGHOUSE SAID LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF ITS ANNUAL SALES DERIVE FROM CONTRACTS WITH SOUTH AFRICAN ELECTRICITY ONE OF THE W- WORLD'S LARGEST ELECTRIC UTILITIES
FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WESTINGHOUSE HAD SALES OF TEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
WESTINGHOUSE HAS NO OTHER CONTRACTS WITH AGENCIES IN SOUTH AFRICA
THE LEFT SAYS IT WILL STOP ITS DESTRUCTION WHEN PRESIDENT DUARTE BRINGS THE REBELS INTO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY IN AN OFFICIAL POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT
THAT WON'T HAPPEN SOON IF EVER
BUT IN CONTESTED ZONES THE GUERRILLAS ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN A DE FACTO POWER SHARING REL:ATIONSHIP WITH SAN SALVADOR
<NOISE> THE RULING MEANS RAILROAD UNIONS MAY CONTINUE FOR NOW TO USE THE POTENT WEAPON OF SECONDARY PICKETING
BUT THE RULING ALSO WILL INCREASE PRESSURE ON CONGRESS FROM THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY AND POSSIBLY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TO PASS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING SECONDARY PICKETING OF RAILROADS
CONGRESS TOOK NO ACTION ON A SIMILAR PROPOSAL LAST YEAR
BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
<NOISE> THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
WE AREN'T THRILLED TO DEATH ABOUT IT SAID MR. BRITTON OF THE MISSING SECTION AND THE SPRAWLING HEADLINE
BUT HE INSISTED THAT HE WASN'T EMBARRASSED
MOST PEOPLE THAT READ THE KIND OF SECTION WE PUT OUT DON'T START WITH THE COMICS PAGE
MR. MAGUIRE PHONED HIS BANK BANKERS TRUST COMPANY ONE OF NEW YORK'S BIGGEST AND AN IMPORTANT LENDER TO WALL STREET
HE ASKED FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR LOAN EVEN THOUGH HENDERSON IS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BEST CAPITALIZED SPECIALIST FIRMS
HE WAS STUNNED BY THE RESPONSE
THEY STATED THEY WERE IN NO POSITION TO MAKE COMMITMENTS MR. MAGUIRE SAYS
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
<NOISE> THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
<NOISE> YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
WEST GERMANY IS PLAYING FOR THE LONG TERM SAYS PIERRE LELLOUCHE OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS
IT BELIEVES IT CAN GET EAST GERMANY BACK WITHOUT FALLING UNDER SOVIET DOMINATION ITSELF
MR. LELLOUCHE AND MOST OTHER FRENCHMEN DON'T THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE
JOEY KNOWS HIS ROLE SAYS COACH DEMERS
HE CITES THE TIME A SAINT LOUIS PLAYER SWUNG HIS STICK AT A RED WING NOT KNOWN FOR HIS FIGHTING SKILLS
I TOLD JOEY TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT AGAIN SAYS THE COACH
THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH IF NOT NECESSARILY IN WORDS
SUBSEQUENT GOVERNMENT REPORTS HOWEVER SHOW THAT EMPLOYMENT GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY STRONG IN THE FIRST QUARTER
MOREOVER THE FOURTH QUARTER BUILD UP IN BUSINESS INVENTORIES HAS BEEN REVISED DOWN SOMEWHAT BY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
AS A RESULT THE CENTRAL BANK APPARENTLY IS REVERSING ITS JANUARY MOVE
GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
<NOISE> NOW HE SAID THINGS HAVE BEEN TURNED AROUND
WE HEAR TALK HE SAID THAT IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE
WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ANOTHER FRIENDLY REMINDER WE ARE THE CHANGE
FEDERAL FUNDS NINE AND ONE SIXTEENTH PERCENT HIGH EIGHT AND FIFTEEN SIXTEENTHS PERCENT LOW EIGHT AND FIFTEEN SIXTEENTHS PERCENT NEAR CLOSING BID NINE PERCENT OFFERED
RESERVES TRADED AMONG COMMERCIAL BANKS FOR OVERNIGHT USE IN AMOUNTS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE
S:OURCE FULTON PREBON U. S. A. INCORPORATED
WHEN HU *YAOBANG* WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT SAINT
LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
THEN CAME THE AIR WARS
AFTER DECONTROL NINE MORE AIRLINES INVADED THE MARKET ALL TRYING TO LURE A SHARE OF THE TWENTY MILLION TRAVELERS WHO USE THIS AIRPORT EACH YEAR
IN ASIAN TRADING YESTERDAY <NOISE> THE DOLLAR REBOUNDED FROM WHAT SOME TRADERS SAID WAS AN OVERSOLD CONDITION
WEDNESDAY'S DECLINE TRIGGERED BUY ORDERS AND SOME TRADERS BOUGHT DOLLARS TO COVER SHORT OR OVERSOLD POSITIONS
BUT AFTER CLIMBING TO INTRADAY HIGHS OF ONE POINT EIGHT ZERO FIVE FIVE MARKS AND ONE POINT ONE SIX SIX YEN THE DOLLAR BEGAN SINKING AGAIN
SOUTHLAND WOULD HAVE ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED
THE COMPANY PLANS TO PAY OFF ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LARGELY FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS
SOUTHLAND EXPECTS PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES TO TOTAL EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR
BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS ECONOMIC GROWTH TO REBOUND AFTER THE EFFECTS OF THE STOCK MARKET CRASH WANE
IT FORECASTS A THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT GROWTH FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETEEN NINETY AND STEADILY FALLING INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION RATES
BUT FORECASTERS INSIDE GOVERNMENT AND OUT HAVE A POOR RECORD IN PREDICTING ECONOMIC TRENDS THAT FAR IN THE FUTURE
FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
MOREOVER SOME HOUSING SPECIALISTS SAY PERMIT ACTIVITY IS A POOR INDICATOR OF FUTURE STARTS ARGUING THAT IT REFLECTS CURRENT HOUSING ACTIVITY RATHER THAN PREDICTING FUTURE ACTIVITY
THEY PREDICT THAT INSTEAD OF FALLING HOUSING STARTS WILL IMPROVE IN COMING MONTHS IN REACTION TO INCREASING NEW <NOISE> AND EXISTING HOME SALES
ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS TREND WILL BE THE SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS BEEN BATTERED BY RECESSION AND A HOUSING GLUT
ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT <NOISE> AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THAT THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
BUT MR. EDELL HAS ARGUED THAT MRS. CIPOLLONE HEARD CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF HER HABIT
IN A DISPOSITION READ TO THE COURT IN APRIL MRS. CIPOLLONE SAID SHE WAS INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO SMOKING BECAUSE OF ITS SEDUCTIVE CONNOTATIONS OF HOLLYWOOD AND GLAMOUR
THE CIGARETTE MAKERS' ADVERTISEMENTS REINFORCED THESE PERCEPTIONS AND OTHERS OF THE PRODUCT'S SAFETY THE PLAINTIFF CONTENDS
MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT
MR. ICAHN WANTS TO GIVE HOLDERS A MIXTURE OF TWENTY DOLLARS A SHARE IN CASH AND ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A SHARE FACE AMOUNT OF DEBENTURES
ON SOME LEDGERS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO ADD TO UP TO FIFTY DOLLARS
BUT SOME INSIDERS APPARENTLY PREFER THIRTY SIX DOLLARS TO THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS IN CASH
FOUR T. W. A. VICE PRESIDENTS THREE CURRENT ONE DEPARTED RECENTLY SOLD ALL THEIR SHARES AT THOSE PRICES
RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
SUEZ WHICH HAD TO RAISE ITS CAPITAL SEVERAL TIMES LAST YEAR THROUGH RIGHTS ISSUES TO FUND ITS BELGIAN BATTLE SAYS IT CAN FUND ITS ACQUISITION OF C. I. E.
INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD OR THROUGH SHORT TERM LOANS
ONE SOURCE SAID SUEZ IF VICTORIOUS WOULD LIKELY RESELL PART OF ITS STAKE IN C. I. E.
INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF C. I. E.
INDUSTRIELLE ASSETS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND MINORITY INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TWO BILLION FRANCS
BASICALLY SAYS MS. BANK WE DON'T GIVE KITTENS TO PEOPLE WHO WORK
KITTENS NEED SOCIALIZATION
ONCE A KITTEN IS MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS OLD IT IS CONSIDERED MATURE ENOUGH BY THE A. S. P. C. A. TO BE ON ITS OWN DURING THE DAY
MOBS OF HINDUS RAMPAGED THROUGH NEW DELHI AND BATTLED SIKHS OVER A BUS HIJACKING SUNDAY IN WHICH SIKH EXTREMISTS KILLED TWENTY FOUR HINDUS

UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK CORPORATION WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT HOLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
THE RESULT IS A CONSERVATISM COMPOSED OF CONSERVATIVES WHO DO NOT INTEGRATE THEIR NARROW VALUES INTO THE BROAD RANGE OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE
<NOISE> THEIR VIEWS ARE SOUND ENOUGH BUT EACH IS ONLY ONE RECIPE ON LIFE'S MENU
YET THEY MUST ALL BE VEGETARIANS
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HEALTH DOESN'T REMAIN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE
GREYHOUND CORPORATION WHICH INSTITUTED A COMPANYWIDE SMOKING BAN LAST YEAR SAYS IT WON'T CONSIDER EXEMPTING THE NEW CIGARETTE FROM THE BAN UNLESS IT IS PROVED SAFE
AT GREYHOUND WE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS HARMFUL TO EMPLOYEES' HEALTH ON THE PREMISES SAYS JOHN W. TEETS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
NO ONE HAS COME OUT AND SAID THIS IS A HEALTHY CIGARETTE
TRADERS SAID THE CURRENT BEAR MARKET COULD ENJOY A SHORT RALLY AT SOME POINT
THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY BIG GAINS HOWEVER UNLESS THE U. S. ANNOUNCES SIGNIFICANT CUTS IN ITS BUDGET DEFICIT

<NOISE> THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT THEY HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
<NOISE> AT STAKE COULD BE ITS STANDING AS THE WORLD'S NUMBER SEVEN AND EUROPE'S NUMBER THREE TIRE MAKER
AS AUTO MAKERS BECOME GLOBAL TIRE MAKERS ARE FOLLOWING
BECAUSE PIRELLI EXPORTS ONLY SPECIALTY TIRES TO THE U. S. AND HAS NO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THERE IT LACKS BRAND NAME RECOGNITION AND NEEDS A PARTNER ANALYSTS SAY
BUT WITH THREE ACQUISITION TARGETS FIRESTONE ARMSTRONG TIRE COMPANY AND GENERAL TIRE AND C- RUBBER COMPANY ALREADY TAKEN FEW OPTIONS ARE LEFT
SEPARATELY THE LABOR DEPARTMENT SAID AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS OF U. S. WORKERS FELL POINT THREE PERCENT IN MARCH AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION AND SEASONAL FACTORS

GROWTH THIS YEAR MAY REACH NEARLY FIVE PERCENT MORE THAN DOUBLE THE TWO POINT THREE PERCENT FORECAST FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE
AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
THE SENSE IS THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
THOUSANDS OF AZERBAIJAN WORKERS RALLIED IN THE SOVIET REPUBLIC'S CAPITAL BAKU AFTER A DAY OF WORK STOPPAGES TO BACK DEMANDS FOR GREATER LOCAL AUTONOMY
IN ESTONIA THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF URGED ETHNIC RUSSIAN WORKERS TO END A SIX DAY STRIKE OVER A NEW LAW TIGHTENING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
<NOISE> HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY THAT SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
<NOISE> WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES
GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGES OF INMATES TO FILL NEW FACILITIES
ALTHOUGH SOME CABINET MINISTERS HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN THE MASS ACTION TOOK MANY BY SURPRISE
MR. BENIGNO SAID TALK OF RESIGNING STARTED DURING A CABINET MEETING

NO ONE HAS LESS CREDIBILITY THAN THE MAN DIRECTLY IN CHARGE OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN POLICY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER AMERICAN AFFAIRS ELLIOTT ABRAMS
SOME CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES REFUSE TO HEAR HIM AT ALL OTHERS WILL ONLY LISTEN IF HE TESTIFIES UNDER OATH
ONLY LAST WEEK THE SENATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE THREW HIM OUT OF A CLOSED BRIEFING ON THE ALLEGED INVASION
WHY ANYONE SHOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY ANYTHING MR. ABRAMS SAYS ABOUT CENTRAL AMERICA DEFIES COMPREHENSION
NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
BUT HIS AIDES SAY THAT HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
-(BU)T CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A- BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
ALMOST UNNOTICED IN DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY

THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT
THAT'S HIS SPECIALTY TEACHING CANDIDATES HOW TO PERFORM ON T. V. COACHING POLITICIANS FOR DEBATES IS A SPECIALTY WITHIN A SPECIALTY
AS A COACH SAYS BOB GOODMAN OF BALTIMORE ANOTHER MEDIA CONSULTANT ROGER AILES IS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF
I SEND MY OWN CLIENTS TO HIM
ANALYSTS SAY THEY EXPECT PROCTOR AND GAMBLE'S MOMENTUM TO CARRY INTO NINETEEN NINETY AND BEYOND AND MANY RAISED THEIR FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY ESTIMATES
BRENDA LEE LANDRY OF MORGAN STANLEY RAISED HER ESTIMATE TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS FROM AN EARLIER ESTIMATE OF EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS
KIDDER'S MR. FREEDMAN AND JOSEPH KOZLOFF AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT RAISED THEIR ESTIMATES TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE FROM EIGHT DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS
I CAN SEE A NUMBER CLOSE TO TEN DOLLARS FOR NINETEEN NINETY ONE SAYS MR. KOZLOFF
TO THE EXTENT THE EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION
SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
<NOISE> JOHN SLOAN'S PEOPLE ARE LARGELY TAKEN FOR GRANTED BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY HAVE BEEN THE STARS OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
AS BIG CORPORATIONS HAVE LAID OFF WORKERS BY THE THOUSANDS TO MEET COMPETITIVE PRESSURES SMALL FIRMS HAVE MORE THAN CUSHIONED THE BLOW
THEY HAVE CREATED SOME TEN MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE MADE AT LAST YEAR'S WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS

OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR

WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
MEANWHILE THE SECURITY FIRM'S PARENT COMPANY PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA REPORTED MODEST GAINS IN MOST FINANCIAL CATEGORIES

BROKERS CITED STRONG FOREIGN DEMAND WHICH DROVE UP TRADING VOLUME IN FELDMUEHLE TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES NEARLY FOUR TIMES RECENT LEVELS
<NOISE> BUT THE BROKERS SAID THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ONLY ONE PARTY WAS ACCUMULATING MOST OF THE SHARES
I WAS SHOCKED SAYS MR. KUHLENSCHMIDT
I SAID THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE
I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY STARTED SELLING TIES IN SIZES
BUT I LOOKED AND THERE WASN'T A SIZE ON IT
ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
<NOISE> ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE PRICE EARNINGS RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
MOREOVER MR. FAIR'S PREDICTIONS TEND TO IMPROVE WITH AGE
BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX HE WAS GIVING PRESIDENT FORD THE INCUMBENT'S FOUR POINT ADVANTAGE
AFTER THE ELECTION HE TOOK IT AWAY
UNLIKE LYNDON JOHNSON MR. FORD WASN'T EVER ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT MR. FAIR EXPLAINS FEEBLY
<NOISE> WHEN MR. FAIR PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF HIS EQUATION TODAY IT STILL SHOWS A FORD VICTORY BUT BY A LESS EMBARRASSING MARGIN
THIS NOVEL ECONOMIC APPROACH IGNORES THE MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT CENTRAL BANK INTERVENTION AND ALL THAT MUMBO JUMBO
THAT'S NOT HOW THEY TEACH ECONOMICS AT HAMBURGER U. INSTEAD THE BIG MAC INDEX SIMPLY LOOKS AT WORLD WIDE PRICES OF HAMBURGERS AT TODAY'S EXCHANGE RATES
THAT QUICKLY SHOWS WHICH CURRENCIES ARE TOO STRONG OR WEAK AND BY HOW MUCH

WITHIN TWO HOURS DAYTON HUDSON COMMON HIT FIFTY NINE A SHARE ON THE BIG BOARD AND UP TO SIXTY THREE IN OTHER MARKETS
PEOPLE TOOK POSITIONS IN THE STOCK SIMPLY ON THE RUMOR OF A TAKEOVER BY SOMEONE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN BOESKY WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON HUDSON HOWEVER WERE MAD
SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE TROUT TO THE FLY
THAT LEAVES RETAIL BROKERAGE FIRMS WITH A STARK CHOICE
THEY CAN MOVE ONTO THE INSTITUTIONAL FIRMS' TURF AND FIGHT FOR A TOP SPOT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
OR THEY CAN SETTLE INTO THE SECOND RANK OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS PERHAPS FOREVER
THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT
IN CONTRAST IF THE UTILITY BEGAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THEY THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW HE SAID
IN EITHER CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE UTILITY'S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED HE SAID
<NOISE> ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
MR. REICHLER RECENTLY STUNNED SOME LIBERALS WHEN HE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS QUEST TO WIN U. S. AID FOR ITS POLICE FORCE AND MILITARY
SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
<NOISE> MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA ALSO GOT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
ADMINISTRATORS BLAME THE HIGH COST OF CARE ON SUCH FACTORS AS RISING SALARIES WHICH THEY SAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS SIXTY PERCENT OF EXPENSES
THEY SAY A NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE FORCES THEM TO PAY BONUSES FOR QUALIFIED HELP
BUT EVEN AT THIS PRICE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVICE CAUSED INFECTIONS THAT LED TO SEVERE COMPLICATIONS
<NOISE> ROBINS STILL CONTENDS OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURIES
THE COMPANY ALSO INSISTS THE SHIELD ISN'T ANY MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHER I. U. D.S
NE WIN'S SINGLE PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM LONG HAS BEEN UNPOPULAR BUT IT HAS REMAINED IN POWER LARGELY BECAUSE OF MILITARY SUPPORT
IN HIS TWENTY SIX YEAR RULE NE WIN TRANSFORMED BURMA FROM ONE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA'S RICHEST SOCIETIES TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES
UNDER HIS BURMESE WAY TO SOCIALISM THE STATE TOOK CONTROL OF ALMOST ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE
THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF THE RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
<NOISE> THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
OUR PROBLEM IS GETTING THIS VERY VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY WORK SAYS ANTHONY SIMONDS GOODING BRITISH SATELLITE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
OUR CREDIBILITY IS CLOSE TO ZERO UNTIL THEN
SOME ANALYSTS TAKE A HARSHER VIEW
THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION MARK OVER B. S. B. MANAGEMENT SAYS MARK ASTAIRE A MEDIA ANALYST AT U. K. BROKERS HOARE GOVETT LIMITED
SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
HE JOINED M. I. FIVE STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION
IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
A SOURCE CLOSE TO TEXACO SAID THAT WHILE TEXACO IS ANXIOUS TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER ELEVEN IT ISN'T IN THE COMPANY'S OR SHAREHOLDERS' INTEREST TO RUSH INTO A SETTLEMENT
IT'S NORMAL FOR CREDITORS TO WANT A QUICK SETTLEMENT
BUT TEXACO'S SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A BIG SAY IN THIS CASE AND THEY AREN'T PUSHING FOR A SETTLEMENT FOR SETTLEMENT'S SAKE THE SOURCE SAID
BUT ON TUESDAY KIDDER PEABODY'S JACK KIRNAN DROPPED CHRYSLER TO A HOLD RATING
VANS AND TRUCKS ARE SELLING WELL HE CONCEDES BUT CHRYSLER'S CAR SALES HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING
HE ALSO FIGURES CHRYSLER WILL TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AMERICAN MOTORS WHICH IT ACQUIRED WEDNESDAY
BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
THE MINISTERS NEXT WILL GO TO KUWAIT THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND IRAQ ALL SAID TO BE PRODUCING BEYOND THEIR QUOTAS
FINAL STOPS ON THIS LEG OF THE TOUR WILL BE QATAR AND IRAN
A SECOND TRIP TO OTHER OPEC COUNTRIES IS SET FOR NOVEMBER
THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CREATION OF SUPERREGIONAL BANKS MIGHT NOT BE OPEN LONG
THEN WE WILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF CONSOLIDATING OUR POSITIONS
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
WHAT HAS DISTINGUISHED US IS THAT OUR RETURNS ON ASSETS AND EQUITY ARE FAR ABOVE AVERAGE
MAINTAINING THOSE LEVELS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE
YET HE STRIVES TO REASSURE CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS CALLING HIMSELF A SCANDINAVIAN STYLE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT WHO APPRECIATES THE BENEFITS OF CAPITALISM

THE FEES WEREN'T DISCLOSED
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
BANKERS TRUST'S QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWENTY MILLION A YEAR EARLIER

JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION ARE TO BE SCRUTINIZED CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY
THOSE INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS AREN'T LIKELY TO WIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
CHINA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPROVE MOST INVESTMENTS IN EXPORT RELATED INDUSTRIES AND IN PROJECTS COVERING ENERGY TRANSPORT COMMUNICATIONS RAW MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS
A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS IS ALREADY WREAKING HAVOC IN MANY OF CHINA'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES
A FACTORY THAT MAKES NIKE SHOES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE HAS TO RUN A GENERATOR THREE DAYS A WEEK TO STAY IN OPERATION
THE PLANT'S TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ARE STOCKPILING COAL AND OIL FOR POWER IN CASE THEIR SUPPLIES GET CUT OFF
MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE
MEANWHILE CIVIL RICO CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES
FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS WHO CONSULTED ME HAD SUBMITTED THE LOW BID FOR A LARGE MARINA TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON LAKE MICHIGAN
THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL RICO ACTION CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD
NO MATTER WHAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUIT THE LOW BIDDERS ALREADY HAVE FELT THE STING OF SUCH POISONOUS WORDS AS RACKETEER
SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO
I'M PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL BAROMETERS SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INCORPORATED IN PHILADELPHIA

HE SAYS HE EXPECTS PRESIDENT ALFONSIN TO START COMING REGULARLY NEXT YEAR
IN MORE INNOCENT TIMES THE LEGAL PROFESSION WAS AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB THAT LOOKED AFTER ITS OWN
SQUABBLES WERE SETTLED BEHIND THE COURTHOUSE
LAWYERLY MISDEEDS WERE HUSHED UP OR HURRIEDLY RESOLVED
CLIENTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SCANDALOUS TO SUE THE FAMILY OR COMPANY LAWYER
GENERAL RAMOS ALSO CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES WERE LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED
GENERAL RAMOS SAID THE MILITARY WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN PERSONNEL NEAR ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS DURING THE UPRISING
HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
THE *BLACKSTONE* FUND BLACKSTONE CAPITAL PARTNERS L. P. IS SEEKING TO RAISE ONE BILLION DOLLARS
IT HAS ALREADY GATHERED SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FUND OFFICIALS SAID
THE FUND'S LIMITED PARTNERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE LARGEST MOST POWERFUL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD SAID PETER G. PETERSON BLACKSTONE GROUP'S CHAIRMAN
DISCUSSING THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT NORMAN BAILEY A WASHINGTON BASED CONSULTANT AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SAID IT'S RIDICULOUS
IT'S WORSE THAN A JERRY BUILT HOUSE
FROM THE BANKS' STANDPOINT HE CHARACTERIZED THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT AS ALMOST WORSE THAN LENDING THEMSELVES THE MONEY
HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY
G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S
FINALLY THOUGH THE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS OF THE COLOR OF BLOOD RESTS IN THE CREATION OF BEM AND HIS STUMBLING JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY
AT LAST HE FINDS A MOMENT OF INNER PEACE AND JOY
YET IT IS A MOMENT QUICKLY ENDED
IN THIS BLEAK WORLD THE FUTURE WOULD SEEM TO BELONG TO THE TYRANTS AND TERRORISTS
FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY FEDERAL POLICY HAS SAPPED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORLD'S STRONGEST AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY
THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF U. S. FOOD EXPORTS BUT WHETHER THOSE EXPORTS ARE SOLD AT A PROFIT OR A LOSS
THE SOONER POLITICIANS STOP TRYING TO HELP FARMERS THE BETTER OFF THE MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCTIVE FARMERS WILL BE
ESPRIT IS NOW A LEANER COMPANY THAT OPERATES MORE CONVENTIONALLY
ACCORDING TO MR. FEDERICO THE OPERATIONS CHIEF EACH DIVISION NOW HAS A BUDGET TO FOLLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE NEW EXECUTIVES IN ESPRIT'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT INCLUDING VETERANS FROM CALVIN KLEIN AND IZOD LACOSTE HAVE TIGHTENED MARKETING AND QUALITY CONTROLS
OFFICERS FOR MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES SAY ESPRIT IS KEEPING CLOSER TRACK OF SALES AND OFFERING CLOTHES MORE IN TUNE WITH TODAY'S TASTES
THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
UNTIL NOW SANCTIONS BACKERS IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE SOUTH AFRICA FOR THEIR OWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL PURPOSES WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FULL COSTS
THE SUFFERING THAT SANCTIONS HAVE INFLICTED ON BLACKS AND THE LOSS OF U. S. INFLUENCE IN THE REGION HAVE NOT IMPRESSED THEM MUCH
BUT THE NEXT ROUND WILL DO MORE SEVERE DAMAGE ON THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS THE SENATE DEBATES WHETHER TO SECOND THE SCORCHED EARTH POLICY THE HOUSE HAS ADOPTED
BROKERAGE FIRMS WHICH NEGOTIATE RATES WITH THE BANKS AND THRIFTS WHOSE C. D.S THEY SELL OFFER SOME OF THE BEST YIELDS
THE AVERAGE YIELD ON A BROKER SOLD THREE MONTH C. D. FOR EXAMPLE WAS EIGHT POINT SIX SIX PERCENT

REAGAN SAID HE WOULD LIKE THE SENATE TO VOTE THIS WEEK ON BORK'S NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT
A QUICK NOTE WOULD PERMIT REAGAN TO MOVE AHEAD WITH A NEW NOMINEE IF AS EXPECTED BORK'S CONFIRMATION IS DEFEATED
SENATE LEADERS PLAN TO BEGIN DEBATE ON THE NOMINATION AS EARLY AS TODAY
THERE IS ALSO A SECURITIES LAW ISSUE WHICH HAD LED THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO FILE AN AMICUS BRIEF ON BEHALF OF TEXACO'S APPEAL
RULE TEN B. THIRTEEN SAYS ONCE A TENDER OFFER BEGINS THE BIDDER MUST TREAT ALL SHAREHOLDERS ALIKE
BUT PENNZOIL OFFERED TO PAY THE GETTY MUSEUM MORE FOR ITS SHARES SOONER THAN IT WOULD PAY OTHER SHAREHOLDERS EVEN IF THE MERGER FAILED
THE S. E. C. SAID THAT THIS PLAINLY VIOLATED RULE TEN B. THIRTEEN
EVEN IF THERE WAS A CONTRACT IT WAS VOID
TEXACO CAN'T BE GUILTY OF INTERFERING WITH A NONEXISTENT CONTRACT
ANALYSTS DOUBT OTHER BIDDERS WOULD BE SO BOLD
THE CHANCES OF BRITOIL ESCAPING B. P. SEEM REMOTE SAYS JEREMY ELDEN AN OIL ANALYST AT THE LONDON STOCKBROKERAGE PHILLIPS AND DREW

IT'S REALLY DISCOURAGING SAYS MARTIN WEIL BEIJING REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR U. S. CHINA TRADE
U. S. COMPANIES COULD STAND TO LOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SALES
SOME U. S. CORPORATIONS COMPLAIN THAT THE MOVE HAS EVEN CAUSED CHINESE BUYERS TO RETHINK PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS THAT AREN'T AFFECTED BY THE POLICY SHIFT
MEANWHILE THE SECURITIES FIRM'S PARENT COMPANY PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA REPORTED MODEST GAINS IN MOST FINANCIAL CATEGORIES
PRUDENTIAL'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS ROSE FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FROM A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
HOWEVER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES
IT HAS BEEN PRESSURING GERMANY TO CUT ITS INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY IMPLICATION CREATE A BIGGER MARKET FOR U. S. EXPORTS
THIS EXPLAINS THE WAR OF WORDS OVER GERMANY'S REFUSAL TO CUT INTEREST RATES FOR MUCH OF LAST YEAR
THE DISPUTE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE PRESENT CENTER RIGHT COALITION GOVERNMENT OF CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL RECORDS ITS EXPECTED ELECTION VICTORY NEXT WEEK
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
BUT MANY TIBETANS CONSIDER THE DALAI LAMA TO BE THEIR RIGHTFUL POLITICAL LEADER AS WELL SOMETHING THE CHINESE CAN'T ACCEPT
TRAVELERS KEPT TIBETANS WELL INFORMED OF THE DALAI LAMA'S RECENT VISIT TO THE U. S. AND HIS CALLS FOR TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE
WHEN THE CHINESE PRESS IN TIBET RESPONDED BY SAVAGELY ATTACKING BOTH THE PRO INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT AND THE DALAI LAMA HIMSELF THE MONKS WERE MOVED TO ACTION
AT DREPUNG THEY SET TO WORK CRAFTING TIBETAN FLAGS WHICH THEY USED IN THE INITIAL PRO INDEPENDENCE MARCH SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH

THE DIFFERENT COLORED CASINGS ARE MADE BY A LOCAL COMPANY
ACCORDING TO SOME PHYSICIANS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH BUSY YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
THEY REFUSE TO REST AND DEMAND TREATMENT WITH ANTIBIOTICS

SUCH DRUGS ARE DESIGNED TO FIGHT BACTERIA NOT VIRUSES
AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISKS

IN JULY MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS ROSE EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IN THE DOLDRUMS FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF HIGH VACANCY RATES AND CHANGES IN THE TAX LAWS
MULTIFAMILY HOUSING STARTS FELL NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT IN JUNE AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT IN MAY
THE REBOUND IN JULY REFLECTS AN EASING OF BACKLOGS IN PERMIT APPROVALS FOR THIS SECTOR MR. SHEEHAN SAID
LAST MONTH'S MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS WERE NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT BELOW THAT OF JULY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
THIS HASN'T BEEN A GOOD YEAR FOR SUNDSTRAND
THE ROCKFORD ILLINOIS AEROSPACE CONTRACTOR EXPECTS TO PAY OUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DISPUTE

THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME IN R. J. R. NABISCO OPTIONS IN SEPTEMBER WAS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND CONTRACTS MR. MOULDS SAID

AFTER THE BUY OUT PROPOSAL WAS MADE PUBLIC THURSDAY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY R. J. R. NABISCO OPTIONS TRADED ON THE C. B. O. E.
IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS CORN AND WHEAT PRICES WERE MOSTLY HIGHER IN A REBOUND FROM MONDAY'S SESSION WHEN CORN SET NEW LIFE OF CONTRACT LOWS
MANY TRADERS BOUGHT CONTRACTS TO COVER SHORT OR SELLING POSITIONS
*ANALYSTS* SAID TECHNICAL FACTORS ALSO PLAYED A PART AS PRICES BACKED AND FILLED THE GAPS LEFT ON PRICE CHARTS BY MONDAY'S STEEP DROP
MR. HENKEL A FORMER ATLANTA ATTORNEY WAS APPOINTED TO THE THREE MEMBER BANK BOARD BY PRESIDENT REAGAN NOVEMBER SEVENTH

BUSINESS AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT GROUPS PREDICT THAT THE CAP WOULD LEAD TO ECONOMIC DISASTER
HOMEOWNER AND ENVIRONMENTALIST GROUPS APPLAUD THE PLAN AS A WAY TO CONTROL THE CITY'S GROWTH
HOUSING STARTS IN THE CITY SET A RECORD LAST YEAR AND ARE ON THE SAME PACE THIS YEAR
WHAT REMAINS FOR HISTORY TO JUDGE IS FIRST HOW WELL HE SUCCEEDED
HERE THE JUDGMENT MAY BE MIXED
WE DO HAVE LESS TAXES AND LESS INFLATION BUT BIGGER SPENDING AND AS MUCH GOVERNMENT AS BEFORE
HISTORY'S SECOND JUDGMENT WILL BE WHETHER HIS YEARS REPRESENT A MERE PASSING CHANGE OR WHETHER THE CHANGE WILL ENDURE
WE CANNOT SAY TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT COMES HEREAFTER AND WHAT COMES HEREAFTER WILL DECIDE MR. REAGAN'S PLACE AMONG OUR PRESIDENTS
SABOTEURS ARE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM SAYS MR. CAIRO REFERRING TO THE BEVY OF PEOPLE WHO SHIELD THE DEBTOR
AT THE OFFICE THE COLLECTOR'S NATURAL ENEMIES ARE SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS AND SECRETARIES SO MR. CAIRO ADVISES CALLING THE DEBTOR BEFORE NINE AFTER FIVE AND DURING LUNCH

<NOISE> MR. WASHINGTON GREW UP IN CHICAGO POLITICS
AS A TEEN AGER HE DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS FOR HIS FATHER ROY A PRECINCT WORKER ON THE SOUTH SIDE
AFTER SERVING AS AN ARMY SERGEANT ON GUAM DURING WORLD WAR TWO HE EARNED A LAW DEGREE FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
HIS MARRIAGE TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ENDED IN DIVORCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE
BUT HE ADVANCED THROUGH A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC PATRONAGE JOBS TO ELECTION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND FINALLY TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHT AND A QUARTER
BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
<NOISE> THE TEXSTYRENE CASE ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DREXEL AND EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY A SUBSIDIARY OF FIRST EXECUTIVE CORPORATION IN LOS ANGELES
DREXEL KEPT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TEXSTYRENE BONDS IT HAD BOUGHT BACK FROM ITS EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS FOR A HUNDRED AND SIX AND A HALF FOR ONLY TWO TRADING DAYS
IT THEN SOLD TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF TEXSTYRENE BONDS FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT TWO TO EXECUTIVE LIFE
WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
MR. BRIGHT IS A QUINTESSENTIAL TEXAS BUSINESSMAN WHOSE FORTUNES HAVE PLUNGED IN RECENT YEARS ALONG WITH THE STATE'S
WITH INTERESTS IN ENERGY REAL ESTATE AND BANKING MR. BRIGHT HAS HAD AN UNLUCKY HAND IN EACH OF TEXAS' MOST TROUBLED INDUSTRIES
<NOISE> FORBES MAGAZINE ESTIMATES THAT MR. BRIGHT'S FORTUNE HAS BEEN HALVED TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A FEW YEARS AGO
THE TROUBLED MAKER OF PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY DIDN'T GIVE ANY ESTIMATES OF ITS EXPECTED LOSSES AND COMPANY OFFICIALS COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SOLITEC EARNED TWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SIX CENTS A SHARE ON REVENUE OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
THE RESULTS INCLUDED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM TAX BENEFITS AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING
FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER THE COMPANY EARNED FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
THE RESULTS INCLUDED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INCOME FROM TAX BENEFITS
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END

MR. MARTENS SAID VITRO WASN'T PREPARED TO AGREE TO THAT CONDITION
<NOISE> HE SAID APPARENTLY ANCHOR IS CONCERNED THAT THE INFORMATION IT IS OFFERING TO PROVIDE WILL GIVE VITRO A BASIS FOR LOWERING THE PRICE

IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
<NOISE> EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE USER FEES
THE IMPROVED RESULTS STEM LARGELY FROM GOLD SALES AT THE COMPANY'S GOLD BAR OPERATIONS IN NEVADA WHERE PRODUCTION BEGAN IN JANUARY

IN AFGHANISTAN HE ADDS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS
NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T ANYONE EITHER TO PROTECT THEM OR THREATEN THEM IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON MORALE

FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SHARES
WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS

INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT

MR. BERGER CLAIMS THE PROBLEM GOES BEYOND SIMPLY RECOVERING THE COST OF IMPROVEMENTS
BECAUSE THE LOFT BOARD'S REIMBURSEMENT ALLOWANCES ARE SO LOW HE SAYS BANKS WON'T MAKE LOANS FOR THE WORK
HE SAYS HE FINANCED HIS IMPROVEMENTS BY TAKING A SECOND MORTGAGE ON ANOTHER BUILDING THAT HE OWNS
THE BOTTOM LINE HE SAYS IS THAT THESE BUILDINGS CANNOT BE MADE SAFE UNDER THESE RULES
THE JOB WILL NOT GET DONE
BOND PRICES ARE STILL SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT TUESDAY MORNING THAT ALAN GREENSPAN WILL REPLACE PAUL VOLCKER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD
FOR EXAMPLE THE SHEARSON LEHMAN INDEX PLUMMETED ABOUT FORTY POINTS TUESDAY AND REGAINED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE POINTS SINCE THEN

ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE DELIVERIES TOOK PLACE IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE LAST MONTH BEFORE THE EMBARGO TOOK EFFECT

THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RULES GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF C. R. S. SYSTEMS LED TO PUBLICATION OF UNREALISTIC SCHEDULES BY THE AIRLINES TO GET BETTER SCREEN POSITIONS
THIS RESULTED IN MORE DELAYS AND A LOT OF PASSENGER FRUSTRATION
IN RETROSPECT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN C. R. S. SYSTEMS WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
THE CONTINUING PROSPECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES SENT STOCK PRICES UP SHARPLY
THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE CLOSED UP TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE EIGHT POINTS AT NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT POINT TWO TWO

THE COMPANY IS INCREASING ITS EMPHASIS ON TRUCKS WHERE ITS JEEPS AND MINIVANS ARE AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S STRONGEST SELLING VEHICLES
IN JUNE CHRYSLER SOLD MORE TRUCKS THAN CARS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND THAT PATTERN MAY CONTINUE
BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN THE U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
CURRENCY LOSSES ALSO COULD EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR
AND BUYING A FUND FOR MORE THAN ITS PORTFOLIO VALUE CAN BE TREACHEROUS SOME *ANALYSTS* SAY
IN NEW YORK *STOCK* EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY LEAR SIEGLER SHARES ROSE A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS
A. F. G. INDUSTRIES SHARES CLOSED AT TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
WICKES SHARES FELL TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS IN AMERICAN *STOCK* EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING TO THREE POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
THE COURT BASED ITS RULING ON A SECTION OF THE LAW STATING THAT THE PROVISION WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE HIGHEST PRICE SHALL BE APPLICABLE
THE PANEL NOTED THAT SINCE MARKET PRICES WERE FAIRLY HIGH WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED THIS PROVISION SET A CEILING ABOVE WHICH REGULATED PRICES COULDN'T RISE
NOW WITH MARKET PRICES LOW IT SERVES AS A PRICE FLOOR BELOW WHICH REGULATED PRICES CAN'T DROP IT SAID
BUT ON TUESDAY KIDDER PEABODY'S JACK KIRNAN DROPPED CHRYSLER TO A HOLD RATING

INSTEAD DAYTON HUDSON'S EARNINGS HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED FOR MORE THAN A YEAR BY MERCHANDISING PROBLEMS IN ITS MERVYN'S DEPARTMENT STORE UNIT
ANALYSTS SAID THE TROUBLE STARTED WITH MERVYN'S CONCENTRATING TOO MUCH ON OPENING NEW STORES AND NOT ENOUGH ON PROVIDING BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE
TOP MANAGEMENT WAS SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEMS SOME ANALYSTS SAID
AND MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN TOO OPTIMISTIC IN PREDICTING THE TIMING OF A TURNAROUND THE ANALYSTS SAID

OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS SAY ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRAWBACKS OF REG NEGS IS THE AMOUNT OF WORK REQUIRED USUALLY SEVERAL MONTHS
IT IS EXTREMELY LABOR INTENSIVE SAYS DAVID DONIGER A LAWYER FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL

HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF A FIFTY DOLLAR PLUS PER TON PROFIT
<NOISE> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SAYS A KEY PLAYER IN THE BATTLE
IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY BECAUSE GENERALE DE BELGIQUE IS RICH NOW

SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO

IN DECIDING TO LEAVE JOHNSON AND SWANSON MR. SWANSON SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR A SMALLER SETTING WHERE HE COULD OFFER MORE PERSONALIZED LEGAL COUNSEL
HE SAID HE WILL START A SOLO PRACTICE SPECIALIZING IN FAMILY BUSINESS MATTERS AND ADVISING TRUSTEES WITH A GOAL OF EXPANDING TO AS MANY AS TEN LAWYERS
BOTH HE AND MR. JOHNSON SAID HIS DEPARTURE IS ON FRIENDLY TERMS
AT THE SAME TIME THE REGION HAS BECOME A MECCA FOR DEVELOPERS ITS RATE OF POPULATION AND JOB GROWTH HAS SLOWED LEAVING SOME MARKETS SEVERELY OVERBUILT
SUCH SUN BELT HOT SPOTS AS ATLANTA NASHVILLE AND PALM BEACH COUNTY FLORIDA ARE ALL STRUGGLING
IN THE LATTER THE POST OFFICE VACANCY RATE HAS HIT THIRTY TWO PERCENT AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING PERMITS ARE FORECAST TO DROP SEVENTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR
ACTUALLY SOMETHING RATHER LIKE THIS DOES HAPPEN BUT ONLY AMONG CERTAIN ELITE GROUPS THAT DEBATE SUCH DETAILED ISSUES
AND THE DEPTH AND OPENNESS OF THIS DEBATE UNQUESTIONABLY IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF STRENGTH IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM
THE ELITES MOREOVER ARTICULATE CHOICES AND CALL A NATION TO ITS IDEALS
SOME OF THE MOST THOUGHTFUL STUDENTS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BELIEVE THAT THE UPBRINGING AND TRAINING OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ELITES ARE THE KEY TO THE SYSTEM'S SUCCESS
TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND

HE ATTRIBUTED MUCH OF THE DAY'S GAIN TO A SQUEEZE ON MARKET MAKERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE STOCK TO SELL
SEVERAL MARKET MAKERS WERE SAID TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THE RISE ON WALL STREET TO END AND HAVE CONSEQUENTLY BEEN HOPING TO SELL SHARES IN LONDON
MONDAY'S SHARP GAIN ON THE NEW YORK EXCHANGE AND TUESDAY'S HIGHER OPENING THERE CAUGHT THEM OFF GUARD

THEY STATED THEY WERE IN NO POSITION TO MAKE COMMITMENTS MR. MAGUIRE SAYS
HOLDERS OF ABOUT TWO OR THREE DOZEN OF THE INITIAL RUN OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TEN DOLLAR NOTES COMPLAINED TO THE RESERVE BANK THAT THE COOK PORTRAIT VANISHED
BUT EXAMINATION OF THE ALLEGEDLY FAULTY NOTES SHOWED EVIDENCE OF VIGOROUS RUBBING AND WILLFUL DAMAGE A RESERVE BANK SPOKESMAN SAYS
ONE COMPLAINER TURNED IN A NOTE THAT HE SAID HAD SHRIVELED WHEN HE LEFT IN THE SUN ON A CAR DASHBOARD
THE BANK DID ITS OWN DASHBOARD TEST AND PROVED IT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
THEY SUSPECT THE MAN LAID THE NOTE ON A HOT RADIATOR

THE NORMALLY PLODDING SEARS IS NOW COPYING WARD'S SPECIALTY STORE SCHEME
ON WEDNESDAY IT AGREED TO BUY WESTERN AUTO SUPPLY COMPANY ITS THIRD SUCH VENTURE INTO SPECIALTY RETAILING IN RECENT MONTHS
LATER THIS YEAR SEARS PLANS TO OPEN SELF CONTAINED APPLIANCE AND HOME SHOPS TO COMPETE WITH WARD
SEARS IS ALSO FOLLOWING WARD'S FORAY INTO SELLING MORE BRANDED MERCHANDISE ESPECIALLY IN APPLIANCES
AND IT IS BRANCHING OUT OF MALLS TO OPEN SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD STORES THAT COULD WHITTLE AWAY WARD'S CUSTOMER BASE
SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN *NIGHTS* SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM BOTH FROM HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER

HIS BEST PITCH IS HIS SINKER AND IT'S A GREAT ONE

IT'S STUDY ATTITUDE AND CONCENTRATION AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEREVER I PUT MY GLOVE TONIGHT THURSDAY IS MOSTLY WHERE THE BALL WENT
THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THEY GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE

THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR
THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF SUBSTANTIVE GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT
AND A MESSAGE THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WILL BE STRONGLY DELIVERED
THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S- S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO

EVEN AFTER FINDING A BUYER COMPLETING A FORECLOSURE SALE IS HARDLY ROUTINE
BROKERS AT MERRILL LYNCH REALTY RECALL A SALE THAT WAS DELAYED FOR A MONTH BY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIEN ON THE PROPERTY
ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED
WE WERE AT THE CLOSING TABLE WHEN THIS ALL CAME OUT SAYS WANDA HUTCHINS THE MERRILL LYNCH AGENT
INVALID FORECLOSURES ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE
MR. SMILOW SAID THAT THE COMPANY WON'T HAVE TO SELL ANY ADDITIONAL ASSETS TO FINANCE A NEW BUY OUT
BUT IT WILL HAVE A LOT MORE DEBT THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY
AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED HE SAID PLAYTEX APPAREL WILL HAVE TOTAL DEBT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
PLAYTEX HOLDINGS' DEBT WILL APPROACH ONE BILLION DOLLARS
MR. GIULIANI DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS FROM THIS NEWSPAPER YESTERDAY
MR. ROMANO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ARREST OF THE MEN IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS HASTY
PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION SAY TALKS BETWEEN GOLDMAN SACHS AND THE S. E. C. HAVEN'T BEGUN YET NOR HAVE TALKS BETWEEN MR. FREEMAN AND THE S. E. C.
AND AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FIRM LAWRENCE PEDOWITZ MAINTAINS THAT GOLDMAN ITSELF WAS BLAMELESS IN MR. FREEMAN'S WRONGDOING
THE FIRM HAD STATE OF THE ART COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT MR. PEDOWITZ SAYS
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT INADEQUATE
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME THINGS NO COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT CAN PICK UP
AND THE COMMISSION IS ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THAT THE WEAKER DOLLAR DOESN'T KEEP AMERICANS AWAY
<NOISE> WE'RE TRYING TO URGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO STABILIZE PRICES SO THAT THEY DON'T FLUCTUATE AS MUCH AS THE DOLLAR SAYS SPOKESMAN NEIL MARTIN
EVEN SO SOME PRICES THOSE FOR MANY LUXURY HOTELS IN ITALY AND FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN SOARING
IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORP. A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO O- KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
CLOSURE COULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
COSTS ARE ANOTHER PROBLEM
DOCTOR RESNICK SAYS ULTRASOUND SCREENINGS FOR PROSTATE CANCER CAN COST UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A TRADITIONAL PROSTATE EXAM
ALSO HE SAYS THE ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE TAKES FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES COMPARED WITH FIVE MINUTES FOR THE TRADITIONAL METHOD
ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES

WEST GERMANY IS PLAYING FOR THE LONG TERM SAYS PIERRE LELLOUCHE OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS
IT BELIEVES IT CAN GET EAST GERMANY BACK WITHOUT FALLING UNDER SOVIET DOMINATION ITSELF
MR. LELLOUCHE AND MOST OTHER FRENCHMEN DON'T THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE
HOW WILL THE COMPANY DEAL WITH ITS DEBT AND OPERATIONS AFTER THE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP
MR.
STEGEMEIER IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT AFTER HE BECOMES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE COMPANY SPOKESMAN SAID
IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE LEARNING OUR WAY WITH THE ALLANTE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
THE CAR IS DOING THE THINGS THAT WE WANT IT TO DO FOR US AS FAR AS GETTING VISIBILITY FOR THE DIVISION AND BEING AN IMAGE CAR
SINCE IT'S BEEN A NEW ENTITY FOR CADILLAC AND OUR DEALERS WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL SALES VOLUME WOULD BE
AGFA GEVAERT IS A RIDGEFIELD PARK NEW JERSEY MAKER OF PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES THAT IS OWNED BY BAYER A. G. OF WEST GERMANY
AGFA GEVAERT ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK IT WOULD SEEK TO ACQUIRE THE EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF MATRIX IT DIDN'T ALREADY OWN FOR TEN DOLLARS A SHARE
MATRIX SAID AT THAT TIME THAT ITS BOARD REVIEWED THE OFFER BUT THE RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW WEREN'T ANNOUNCED
THE ADVERTISEMENT ANNOUNCING THE TENDER OFFER SAYS A MERGER AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE TWO FIRMS LAST WEEK
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
MANY PEOPLE CRITICIZE ADS THAT GLORIFY JUNK
SOME SINGLED OUT AS CONTRADICTORY A COOKING OIL AD TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO CUT DOWN ON CHOLESTEROL BUT FEATURING FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES
IT'S ALSO DISHONEST SOME SAID TO OMIT INFORMATION OR HIDE IT IN SMALL PRINT
THEY NOTED THAT ADS FOR HIGH FIBER CEREALS NEGLECT TO MENTION THEIR SALT AND SUGAR CONTENT
THE MICRO CHANNEL IS OUR STRATEGY SAID BILL LOWE THE HEAD OF I. B. M.'S P. C. DIVISION
WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY SAYING THAT SINCE APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHEN THE P. S. TWO LINE WAS INTRODUCED
IF WE KEPT CHANGING DIRECTIONS I COULD SEE PEOPLE QUESTIONING THAT
WE GIVE A LOOK LIKE A GENERATION BEFORE THEM LIVED HERE SAYS MR. MARDER
THAT'S WORTH MONEY
IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE THE COMPANY HAS DOUBLED ITS PROFITS AND TRIPLED ITS STAFF HE ADDS
SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO BRITISH INVESTORS' REGARD FOR THESE SERVICE COMPANIES
U. S. AND BRITISH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS DIFFER FOR THE GOOD WILL ARISING FROM ACQUISITIONS YIELDING HIGHER REPORTED EARNINGS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES
SOME ANALYSTS SUGGEST U. K. INVESTORS HAVE FEW HIGH GROWTH INDUSTRIES TO CHOOSE FROM AND SO LOOK FAVORABLY ON SERVICE COMPANIES
THAT LEAVES RETAIL BROKERAGE FIRMS WITH A STARK CHOICE
THEY CAN MOVE INTO THE INSTITUTIONAL T- FIRMS' TURF AND FIGHT FOR A TOP SPOT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
OR THEY CAN SETTLE INTO THE SECOND RANK OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS PERHAPS FOREVER
ASSETS OF TWO HUNDRED GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS ROSE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SEVENTY POINT THREE SIX BILLION
ASSETS OF NINETY THREE BROKER DEALER FUNDS FELL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT OH ONE BILLION DOLLARS
ASSETS OF ONE HUNDRED AND THREE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FELL FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SIXTY SIX POINT ONE THREE BILLION DOLLARS

ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET
YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. NEW YORK
YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
THE PURCHASING MANAGERS SOUNDED MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN MOST ECONOMISTS IN SEVERAL RECENT SURVEYS
MANY ECONOMISTS FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S COLLAPSE ON OCTOBER NINETEEN WILL MAKE SHOPPERS MORE CAUTIOUS ESPECIALLY ON SUCH MAJOR PURCHASES AS AUTOS AND HOMES
SOME ALSO FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S WOES MAY PERSUADE COMPANIES TO POSTPONE CAPITAL SPENDING GAINS UNTIL A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY'S HEALTH EMERGES
NEVERTHELESS MOST ECONOMISTS STILL CONTEND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A RECESSION COMING ANYTIME SOON
TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT

THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT
WE ARE NOT A DISTURBING FORCE IN THIS MARKET AND I DON'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN KICKING THREE JAPANESE FIRMS OUT FROM BEING PRIMARY DEALERS
WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR U. S. MARKETS AND THE U. S. ECONOMY
EQUICOR WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BY EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORP. TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND TO MANAGE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS FOR CORPORATIONS

EXECUTIVES OF BOTH EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORP. SAID THEY EXPECT THE VENTURE TO BE PROFITABLE THIS YEAR
ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE
FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LENDING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
ONE STUMBLING BLOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING

NEGOTIATIONS WILL CONTINUE AT LEAST THROUGH NOVEMBER AND PERHAPS BEYOND AND MIGHT WELL ACHIEVE A COMPROMISE THE ANALYSTS SAY
FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A SHARE AFTER TAXES

IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID

WHAT MAKES MR. TAPLIN THINK HE CAN PULL IT OFF
IT'S A QUESTION OF VISION AND FOCUS HE ASSERTS ADDING I SEE BERKEY AS AN INTERNATIONAL TRADING AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY
NIXDORF'S FOUNDER RECOGNIZED EARLY THAT BUSINESSES NEED SOLUTIONS RELIABLE COMPUTER HARDWARE AND CUSTOM DESIGNED SOFTWARE RATHER THAN JUST COMPUTERS
HALF OF NIXDORF'S SALES COME FROM SOFTWARE THE PROGRAMS THAT RUN COMPUTERS AND OTHER SERVICES
AT I. B. M. COMPUTER HARDWARE WHICH IS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COMPETITION ACCOUNTS FOR TWO THIRDS OF SALES
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
THE TIGERS DON'T LIKE TO STRESS THE SOURCE OF THEIR BASEBALL PROWESS
THE TEAM'S PRESS RELEASES SAY THE TEAM HAS ENGLISH BORN AND BRED PLAYERS
UNDER QUESTIONING IN THE STADIUM PUB MR. HUNT ADMITS TO HAVING RECRUITED A DUTCHMAN A PAKISTANI AND AN AMERICAN THIRD BASEMAN
<NOISE> BUSH SAID HIS SEARCH FOR A RUNNING MATE IS PROCEEDING IN AN ORDERLY FASHION
SOURCES SAID THAT SENATE G. O. P. LEADER DOLE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED BY BUSH THAT HE WAS AMONG ABOUT A DOZEN VICE PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS
BUSH WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IS ASSURED SAID HE WON'T DISCLOSE HIS CHOICE UNTIL NEXT MONTH'S PARTY CONVENTION
TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
<NOISE> ONE STUMBLING BLOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A A LOOK SO IT CAN BE *DETERMINED* WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT THE OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAID THE MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
AN UPJOHN SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY PLANNED TO MARKET ROGAINE TO WOMEN ALL ALONG
HOWEVER F. D. A. APPROVAL FOR USING THE DRUG ON MEN CAME FIRST BECAUSE UPJOHN DIDN'T TEST THE PRODUCT ON ENOUGH WOMEN INITIALLY
UPJOHN SAID IT BEGAN TESTING ROGAINE ON WOMEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ABOUT FOUR YEARS AFTER TESTS ON BALDING MEN BEGAN
OTHER PLANNED FEATURES OF THE OSAKA AIRPORT SUGGEST THAT THE PLANNERS HAVEN'T LEARNED THE LESSONS OF NARITA
THE NEW AIRPORT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED ON A MAN MADE ISLAND IN OSAKA HARBOR
ACCESS WILL BE BY A SINGLE DOUBLE DECKER BRIDGE FOR CARS AND TRAINS MAKING THE AIRPORT VULNERABLE TO CIVIC UNREST OF THE KIND THAT HAS PLAGUED NARITA
COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE SEEING THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR LINES LENDING TO BLUE CHIP CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DRIED UP
BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
IN THE CREDIT MARKETS FRIDAY RATES ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS ROSE
THE RATE ON THE LATEST THIRTEEN TR- WEEK TREASURY BILL INCREASED TO FIVE POINT FOUR OH PERCENT BID FROM FIVE POINT THREE SEVEN PERCENT THURSDAY

WE DON'T DEVELOP ELEGANT SOLUTIONS IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM HE CONTINUES EXPLAINING THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T MAKE SOFTWARE AND THEN SEARCH FOR CUSTOMERS
WE LISTEN TO OUR CLIENTS
IF THEY HAVE A COMPUTER PROBLEM WE TRY AND DEVELOP AND PACKAGE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE SOLD TO A LARGE BASE OF CUSTOMERS
<NOISE> DAYTON HUDSON MAY GET SOME THINGS IT DIDN'T REQUEST FROM THE MINNESOTA LEGISLATURE
SOME POLITICAL LEADERS ARE DISCUSSING WHETHER TO AMEND THE DAYTON HUDSON PROPOSAL TO BAN SUCH CONTROVERSIAL MANAGEMENT TAKEOVER DEFENSES AS GOLDEN PARACHUTES POISON PILLS AND GREENMAIL PAYMENTS
THIS SHOULD BE A TWO WAY STREET SAID MICHAEL HATCH COMMISSIONER OF THE MINNESOTA COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
MANAGEMENTS SHOULDN'T BE ENTRENCHED
<NOISE> ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED
TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
THE FINDING UNIFORMLY SURPRISED LONGTIME RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD
<NOISE> THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE BEHIND T. H. A. SAYS DOCTOR LEON THAL A RESEARCHER AT SAN DIEGO VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL
BUT THE RESULTS WERE OVERWHELMING AND WHEN YOU GET RESULTS LIKE THAT OUT OF THE BLUE THE FIRST REACTION IS TO BE SKEPTICAL
MITI ISN'T THE ONLY GOVERNMENT BODY INVOLVED
THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGENCY WILL SPEND ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON SUPERCONDUCTIVITY RESEARCH OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ITS OWN SUPERCONDUCTIVITY PROGRAMS
TOKYO'S MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT PLANS TO SET UP A TEAM TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES APPLY SUPERCONDUCTIVITY RESEARCH TO PRODUCTS
CAR SALES APPARENTLY HAVE LEVELED OFF AFTER DISAPPOINTING RESULTS EARLY IN THE YEAR FOLLOWED BY A SHARP UPTICK IN LATE JANUARY
BIGGER INCENTIVES FUELED THE REBOUND AND HAVE HELPED SUSTAIN THE SALES PACE
CHRYSLER CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE BOOSTED CASH REBATES TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON SOME MODELS
STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
<NOISE> SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE COMMISSION HAS ALLOWED COMPANIES BASED IN THE CONVENTION CITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO LOCAL HOST COMMITTEES RAISING FUNDS TO ATTRACT THE EVENT
THEN THE F. E. C. ALLOWED DONATIONS BY NATIONAL CORPORATIONS WITH LOCAL OUTLETS
<NOISE> THIS YEAR IT GAVE GENERAL MOTORS PERMISSION TO LEND THROUGH LOCAL DEALERSHIPS FLEETS OF CARS FOR PARTY V. I. P.S TO USE DURING EACH CONVENTION
POSSIBLY THE LEAGUE REPRESENTATIVES FIGURE ANY EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD CAN FILL OUT A SIMPLE FORM
THAT SEEMS A LOGICAL CONCLUSION BY ANY GROUP ALSO CAPABLE OF PRESUMING ALL EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS BELONG IN A VOTING BOOTH
OR PERHAPS THEY ASSUME I'LL ENTHUSIASTICALLY PICK UP WHERE THEY ENTHUSIASTICALLY LEAVE OFF
N. B. C.'S T. V. COVERAGE ALSO GETS ITS SHARE OF THE BLAME
MARKETERS SAY IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE FOR EXCITEMENT TO BUILD <NOISE>
THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS WHICH LED TO RATINGS THAT WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED DIDN'T HELP EITHER
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT QUARTERS THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS WERE MASKED BY SEVERAL SPECIAL CHARGES
BEFORE A SIX MILLION LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PHILLIPS HAD PROFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF SEVENTEEN MILLION OR FIVE CENTS A SHARE
THAT PROFIT INCLUDED A TWELVE MILLION GAIN FROM ASSET SALES AND AN EIGHT MILLION CHARGE FROM STAFF REDUCTIONS
THE COMPANY ALSO SAID BOYD W. HENDRICKSON CARE'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER PLANS TO RESIGN NOT LATER THAN JULY ONE
ACCORDING TO PROXY MATERIAL FOR THE CARE ANNUAL MEETING HELD HERE YESTERDAY HE ALSO PLANS TO RESIGN AS A DIRECTOR
A SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN SELECTED
MR. HENDRICKSON FORTY TWO YEARS OLD SAID HE IS LEAVING TO START HIS OWN NURSING HOME CONCERN
TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH
COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

FRANK PEREZ A RETIRED DIPLOMAT RECALLS THE DAY HE LEFT FOR A TWO YEAR STINT AS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN TURKEY
FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAYS SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS SOGGY AND MOLDY
WHAT'S MORE THE TREMENDOUS CAPITAL ADVANTAGE THAT JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS NOW ENJOY BOTH BY VIRTUE OF SIZE AND THE ROBUST YEN EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM
BLACKSTONE'S MR. PETERSON POINTS OUT THAT THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF NIKKO SECURITIES IS TWICE AS LARGE AS THE COMBINED MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF MERRILL LYNCH AMERICAN EXPRESS AND MANUFACTURERS HANOVER
CAPITAL IS BECOMING KING AND CAPABLE OF OVERWHELMING THE TRANSIENT ADVANTAGES CLEVER FINANCIAL INNOVATIONS CAN PROVIDE
THE CONTRACT CALLS FOR SECURITY MUTUAL TO INSTALL THE INSURANCE MACHINE A LIFE ANNUITY AND HEALTH INSURANCE INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPED BY E. D. S.
AN E. D. S. SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE PRECISE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT BUT SAID ITS VALUE EXCEEDS TEN MILLION
THE CONTRACT WHICH TAKES EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WILL EXPIRE IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND
IN DECEMBER AUTO LOANS INCREASED BY TWO POINT FIVE TWO BILLION OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
A FED ECONOMIST SUGGESTED THIS LARGE INCREASE MAY REFLECT SLOWER GROWTH EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS CONSUMERS USED HOME EQUITY LOANS TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD BALANCES
ALL THE INCREASES ARE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED
THE NORMALLY PLODDING SEARS IS NOW COPYING WARD'S SPECIALTY STORE SCHEME
ON WEDNESDAY IT AGREED TO BUY WESTERN AUTO SUPPLY COMPANY ITS THIRD SUCH VENTURE INTO SPECIALTY RETAILING IN RECENT MONTHS
LATER THIS YEAR SEARS PLANS TO OPEN SELF CONTAINED APPLIANCE AND HOME SHOPS TO COMPETE WITH WARD
SEARS IS ALSO FOLLOWING WARD'S FORAY INTO SELLING MORE BRANDED MERCHANDISE ESPECIALLY IN APPLIANCES
AND IT IS BRANCHING OUT OF MALLS TO OPEN SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD STORES THAT COULD WHITTLE AWAY WARD'S CUSTOMER BASE
OIL CHANGE CENTERS NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN FRANCHISED UNITS AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
THAT'S EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY YEAR END WITH REVENUE REACHING SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES

THESE INCLUDE SOME MAJOR OIL COMPANIES INTERESTED IN BRAND AWARENESS
BLAME IT ON A LOCAL NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN ORDINANCE THAT BARS WORLDLY EMPLOYMENT OR BUSINESS EXCEPT WORKS OF NECESSITY AND CHARITY ON SUNDAY
RECREATION RELATED BUSINESSES SUCH AS MOVIE THEATERS AND BOWLING ALLEYS ALSO ARE EXEMPT
THE PURPOSE OF THE BAN IS TO KEEP DOWN TRAFFIC THE TOWN SAYS
WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
BUT I WON'T DO IT
I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
THE S. E. C. SAYS ITS RULE PROHIBITS SHAREHOLDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A TENDER OFFER FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL PROFITS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SELLING SHORT OTHER STOCK IN THE COMPANY
IN A SHORT SALE A HOLDER SELLS BORROWED STOCK THAT HE AGREES TO REPLACE LATER
IN EFFECT THE HOLDER IS BETTING THAT THE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK WILL DROP ALLOWING HIM TO PROFIT BY REPLACING THE STOCK WITH CHEAPER STOCK
WHAT IF ANYTHING WILL COME OF ALL OF THIS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REMAINS TO BE SEEN OF COURSE
THE YEAR ALSO MAY YIELD ANSWERS TO SOME OTHER QUESTIONS CURRENTLY PUZZLING INVESTORS WILL THE ECONOMY FINALLY GET MOVING AGAIN
AND IF IT DOES WILL RENEWED INFLATION BE ALL BUT INEVITABLE
WILL THE POLITICAL REALIGNMENT IN CONGRESS HELP OR HURT EFFORTS TO WHITTLE THE NATION'S HUGE TRADE AND BUDGET DEFICITS
DU PONT ROSE FOUR AND A QUARTER TO ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS
THE COMPANY WHICH OWNS CONOCO SAID IT KNEW OF NO SPECIFIC REASON FOR THE PRICE GAIN
BUT IT NOTED THAT THE STOCK SEEMS TO BE TRADING AS AN OIL ISSUE

THERE IS NO DENYING THAT A PROGRAM OF ROUTINE TESTING AND CONTACT NOTIFICATION PRESENTS SOME CHALLENGES
FEW DECISIONS ON AIDS ARE EASY
BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK CANNOT DISCOURAGE US FROM FACING UP TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE
TO GO ON AS WE HAVE BEEN
WE CANNOT DO THAT
WE ASSUME THERE MAY BE OTHER COMPANIES WITH THIS KIND OF PROBLEM MR. NAGATA SAID
OTHER FINANCE PROFESSIONALS HOWEVER PLAYED DOWN THE EXTENT OF SUCH PROBLEMS
ONE ANALYST SAID THE SCOPE OF TATEHO'S PROBLEMS IS RIDICULOUS
MOST COMPANIES ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE
THE PHILIP MORRIS MAGAZINE ENJOYS BY FAR THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION OF ANY COMPANY MAGAZINE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION COPIES
THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE
REPRESENTATIVE GEPHARDT IS AT AGE FORTY SIX THE EMBODIMENT OF THE COOL POST WATERGATE POLITICIAN
HIS HAIR NEVER SEEMS RUFFLED HIS TIE WOULD NO DOUBT HANG STRAIGHT DOWN IN A TYPHOON
YET HE SPRINGS FROM THE GRITTY ALMOST TRIBAL WORLD OF SOUTH SAINT LOUIS
THE PHRASE WINTER OLYMPICS IS THE ONLY ITEM PROTECTED BY A TRADEMARK THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE SUIT
IT IS AMONG MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED WORDS PHRASES AND SYMBOLS FOR WHICH THE ASSOCIATION HAS GAINED TRADEMARK PROTECTION IN CANADA
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE U. S. OLYMPIC COMMITTEE SAID MOST SUCH WORDS AND SYMBOLS ARE SIMILARLY PROTECTED IN THE U. S.
CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID
IT WAS THROUGH THESE CORRESPONDENT BANKS THAT MANUFACTURERS GOT ALL OF THESE ENERGY LOANS THAT HAVE SOURED
HOWEVER ONE MANUFACTURERS EXECUTIVE SAID HE DOUBTED CORRESPONDENT BANKING WOULD BE ELIMINATED IN LIGHT OF THAT BUSINESS'S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RECENTLY
MR. REICHLER RECENTLY STUNNED SOME LIBERALS WHEN HE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS QUEST TO WIN U. S. AID FOR ITS POLICE FORCE AND MILITARY
SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA ALSO GOT SEVEN MILLION IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT

TRADERS SAID BANKING ISSUES LED THE MARKET LOWER IN RESPONSE TO THE REPORTS
UNCONVINCED THE HARRISBURG CITY COUNCIL IN APRIL PASSED AN ORDINANCE REQUIRING LOCAL EMPLOYERS WITH TEN OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO GIVE UP TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE
HARRISBURG IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST U. S. CITY TO PASS SUCH A STATUTE AND IT IS MUCH STRICTER THAN ANY STATE LEGISLATION
FOR INSTANCE WISCONSIN PASSED A PARENTAL LEAVE LAW IN APRIL WHICH PROVIDES FOR ONLY SIX WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE AND EXEMPTS COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES
THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
THE LAW EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN CATCH TWENTY TWO
YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO FILL OUT YOUR OWN TAX RETURN ROGER TELLS ME
BUT THE LAW ALSO SAYS YOU PROBABLY NO LONGER CAN DEDUCT THE COST OF HIRING PROFESSIONAL HELP
CABLE OPERATORS ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRICE CUTTING PROGRAMS
FOR ONE THING BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION WHICH TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST THE OPERATORS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RAISE RATES FOR BASIC CABLE SERVICE
IN ADDITION THE PAY NETWORKS ARE CUTTING THE PRICES THEY CHARGE OPERATORS
THAT MAY SIGNAL THAT EQUITY LINKED EUROBONDS AREN'T GOING TO DISAPPEAR EVEN IF EQUITIES FALL OUT OF INVESTOR FAVOR
DIFFICULT MARKETS WON'T END THE GAME SAYS A SYNDICATION OFFICIAL FOR ONE LARGE U. S. INVESTMENT HOUSE
WE'LL JUST ADAPT THE PRODUCT
THE WINNERS THE AMERICANS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A TIME OF FIVE MINUTES AND FOUR SECONDS
CANADA CLOCKED IN AT FIVE MINUTES AND THIRTY FIVE SECONDS
IN THE GLORY OF THE MOMENT THE DETROIT POLICEMEN HUGGED ONE ANOTHER AND SHOUTED WE'RE NUMBER ONE
WITH LESS REGULATORY AND POLITICAL PRESSURE CONRAIL WAS ABLE TO ABANDON ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF TRACK BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
ABOUT HALF OF THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY SHORT LINE RAILROADS NONUNION RAILROADS THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AT A LESSER COST
THEY BRING THE BUSINESS TO US AND WE HANDLE IT AS A TRUNK LINE
MR. BERGERON AND INVESTCORP SAY THEY HAVE AMBITIOUS MEDIUM TERM PLANS FOR CHAUMET
LONG RESTRICTED TO THE HIGH END OF THE MARKET CHAUMET MAY MOVE INTO MIDDLE RANGE JEWELRY
FOLLOWING A TREND IN THE LUXURY GOODS BUSINESS IT COULD ALSO DIVERSIFY INTO WATCHES AND OTHER ACCESSORIES OR INTO THE PERFUME BUSINESS
INVESTCORP EXECUTIVES ALSO SAY THAT CHAUMET AIMS TO EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY PARTICULARLY IN THE U. S. WHERE IT ALREADY HAS A SHOP IN NEW YORK AND IN ASIA
PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS

BUT A RAFT OF SMALLER ELECTRONICS ISSUES HELPED PUSH THE NASDAQ ELECTRONICS GROUP'S AVERAGE UP MORE THAN ONE PERCENT
BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT DAY ISN'T WORRIED
WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAYS
WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE IS BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
THE PLAN WAS CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONFORM WITH THE CONSERVATIVE GRADUALIST PRINCIPLES OF THE EXISTING BAKER PLAN DEVISED BY FORMER SECRETARY BAKER
THAT APPROACH FEATURES A MENU OF OPTIONS BY WHICH BANKS AND DEBTOR COUNTRIES MIGHT VOLUNTARILY NEGOTIATE NEW LOANS OR REDUCTIONS IN DEBT
THE PLAN OPPOSES GOVERNMENT ASSUMPTION OF BANK RISK OR BAILOUTS AND STRESSES NEW LENDING OVER DEBT RELIEF
THE GANGS ARE EVEN BECOMING ADEPT AT THEIR OWN SORT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS-
THEY BUY FOOD FOR THE ELDERLY AND SNEAKERS FOR KIDS MAKING WARY *ALLIES* OF BOTH
THEY SPONSOR PICNICS WHERE THEY PUT HUGE BANNERS FLAUNTING THEIR NAMES AND COLORS
SOUTH AFRICA ANGOLA AND CUBA ENDED A ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT OR A DATE TO MEET AGAIN

N. B. C.'S T. V. COVERAGE ALSO GETS ITS SHARE OF THE BLAME
MARKETERS SAY IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF EXCITEMENT TO BUILD

IF TEXACO MANAGERS WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FUTURE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO BOOST THE STOCK SAYS AN INFLUENTIAL TEXACO HOLDER
OTHERWISE HE SAYS WHEN THEIR ELECTION COMES AROUND YOU COULD GET A BIG SWING IN THE VOTE IF MR. ICAHN DECIDES TO RENEW THE FIGHT
OF COURSE THERE IS NO WAY TEXACO CAN GUARANTEE ITS INDEPENDENCE IF IT GETS A TAKEOVER BID
I WANTED TO RUN MY AMATEUR THEATER LIKE THE BIG TIME HE REMEMBERS
IT GAVE ME THE FEELING I WAS PART OF A LARGE INDUSTRY
I NEVER WANTED TO GO THE INDEPENDENT CIRCUIT AND RAISE MONEY FROM OIL MEN AND DOCTORS

DOCTOR BRUNDTLAND THINKS THE NORWEGIAN REVOLUTION IS APPARENT IN HER OWN FAMILY
HER HUSBAND AN EDITOR AND OCCASIONAL NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST BASED AT THE NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL AFFAIRS IS A CONSERVATIVE
INDIRECTLY AT LEAST WHAT HE WRITES IS OFTEN CRITICAL OF HER POLICIES A SITUATION THAT VISITING JOURNALISTS INVARIABLY ASK HER ABOUT
HE WENT TO SAY THAT SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CHINA HAD DECIDED TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES WITH THE U. S. AND JAPAN
BUT NO MIRACLE IS GOING TO APPEAR
ISN'T THIS OBVIOUS
A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
MR. ADELMAN SAYS THAT CLEARLY SERVES MOSCOW
ARMS CONTROL SERVES THE SOVIETS MORE THAN IT SERVES US BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORAL EQUIVALENTS HE SAYS
JUST THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE THEY CAN GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY FAVOR PEACE
HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
THE DEPRESSION WASN'T JUST ONE LONG SLUMP AS THE POPULAR IMAGE HAS IT BUT A SERIES OF *RECOVERIES* ABORTED BY FURTHER RECESSIONS
THESE SLUMPS WITHIN THE SLUMP IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WERE BOTH PRECEDED BY LARGE INCOME TAX INCREASES
THIS FOLLY HAS NOT PASSED UNNOTICED BY KEYNESIANS

THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
I KNOW BUT IT'S CLOSE
ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
BEING A LIBERAL IS NOT LIKE BEING A DEMOCRAT
BEING A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN IS LIKE HAVING THE RED PIECES OR THE BLACK PIECES IN A CHECKERS GAME
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORAL IMPLICATIONS
BEING A LIBERAL IS BA:D
YOU CAN BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT IF YOU'RE NOT LIBERAL AND YOU CAN BE A BAD REPUBLICAN IF YOU ARE LIBERAL

I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
MR. DUKAKIS IS IN FACT A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN
HIS FATHER PANOS ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN TWELVE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
HIS MOTHER ARRIVED A YEAR LATER WHEN SHE WAS NINE
HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
<NOISE> THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
FOR EXAMPLE THREE YEAR TREASURY NOTES AS OF LATE YESTERDAY YIELDED ABOUT EIGHT POINT SIX NINE PERCENT
THAT'S LESS THAN A THIRD OF A PERCENTAGE POINT BELOW THE APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT YIELD AVAILABLE ON A THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BOND
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO INVESTORS TO REACH OUT AND BUY LONG TERM TREASURYS AT NINE PERCENT MR. *FROEHLICH* SAID
ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
THE AUTO MAKER SAID THE WAGON VERSION OF THE MEDALLION WILL HAVE A BASE PRICE OF TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE DOLLARS
THE L. X. VERSION OF THE SEDAN WILL START AT TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS
THE MEDALLION BUILT IN FRANCE IS A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE CAR WITH AN ALUMINUM ENGINE
EXCO A UNIT OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS P. L. C. IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BROKERS OF INTERBANK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSITS
UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT HOLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
REAGAN SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON FROM INSIDE WASHINGTON POLITICS
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS CAME A DAY AFTER HE CONCEDED THAT HIS IRAN POLICY WAS A MISTAKE
THE WHITE HOUSE MEANWHILE SOUGHT TO REGAIN POLITICAL MOMENTUM AND BEGAN WEIGHING SUCH IDEAS AS A BUDGET SUMMIT AND A REAGAN SPEAKING TOUR
A FACTORY WORKER LOUNGES IN A STEAMING HOT TUB INSTALLED IN THE BACK OF A CAR
ANOTHER MAN DISPLAYS MUSICAL BATH SLIPPERS
A CROWD GATHERS AROUND AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER WHO IS MAKING A FIG TREE DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF KAREN CARPENTER
THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
THE *PERCENTAGE* CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT
PREVIOUSLY THE RIGHTS OR POISON PILL WERE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY ONLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STOCK WERE IN HOSTILE HANDS
THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT TO PRESCRIBE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LAW WHEN A GOOD OR OR SERVICE IS INVOLVED
LAWS AGAINST FRAUD SHOULD BE NO LESS APPLICABLE TO PLANT CLOSINGS OR MASS LAYOFFS
IN SHORT GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEEK TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS LIVE UP TO THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND SHOULD PROVIDE FOR LEGAL REMEDIES WHEN THEY DO NOT
BUT SUPPORTERS OF TARGETED MAIL SOLICITATION SAY THAT EVEN IF SOME LETTERS ARE IN BAD TASTE AT LEAST THEY ARE FROM LAWYERS SEEKING TO WORK ON THE VICTIMS' BEHALF
<NOISE> VICTIMS ARE *BARRAGED* WITH COME ON LET'S SETTLE SOLICITATIONS FROM INSURANCE COMPANY AND AIRLINE LAWYERS RIGHT AFTER THE CRASH SAYS MR. SHAPERO
THAT'S EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THOSE LAWYERS AREN'T EVEN ON THE VICTIM'S SIDE
MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS AND WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION ARE TO BE SCRUTINIZED CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY
THOSE INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS AREN'T LIKELY TO WIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
CHINA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPROVE MOST INVESTMENTS IN EXPORT RELATED INDUSTRIES AND IN PROJECTS COVERING ENERGY TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATIONS RAW MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS
SUEZ WHICH HAD TO RAISE ITS CAPITAL SEVERAL TIMES LAST YEAR THROUGH RIGHTS ISSUES TO FUND ITS BELGIAN W- BATTLE SAYS IT CAN FUND ITS ACQUISITION OF C.
INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD E- OR THROUGH SHORT TERM LOANS
ONE SOURCE SAYS SUEZ IF VICTORIOUS WOULD LIKELY RESELL PART OF ITS STAKE IN C.
INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF C.
INDUSTRIELLE ASSETS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND MINORITY INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TWO BILLION *FRANCS*
<NOISE> THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON A SEVEN TO SEVEN VOTE LAST MONTH EFFECTIVELY KILLED MR. LUCAS'S NOMINATION TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION
A MAJORITY WAS NEEDED TO SEND THE NOMINATION TO THE FULL SENATE
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT BUSH AND MR. THORNBURGH FOR NOMINATING MR. LUCAS WHO HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS A LAWYER AND NONE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATOR
COMPANIES LISTED BELOW REPORTED QUARTERLY PROFIT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE AVERAGE OF ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES
THE COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST THREE ANALYSTS AND HAD A MINIMUM FIVE CENT CHANGE IN ACTUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE
ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL RESULTS INVOLVING LOSSES ARE OMITTED
GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS
MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
AND YET THIS HAPLESS FELLOW HAD THE GUTS TO SUE HIS FATHER AND THE AMBITION TO GRAB FOR CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION THAT BEARS HIS NAME
HE IS MOST ELUSIVE
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HE TOURED NEW YORK'S TAKEOVER HOUSES BLITHELY CHATTING ABOUT GETTY'S PROBLEMS
WAS HE NAIVELY SEEKING ADVICE OR WAS HE SUBTLY SHOWING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO OUTSIDE THE FIRM FOR ALLIES TO OUST THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT
TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
MR. TRUMP WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE DISPUTED HIS CLAIM THAT HE HOLDS THAT LARGE A GOLDEN NUGGET STAKE AS WELL AS ANY TAKEOVER THREAT
STEPHEN A. WYNN GOLDEN NUGGET'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS DENIED THAT THE BUY BACK IS DEFENSIVE
HE WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
CERTAINLY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED TELEVISION HAS HAD A ROLE IN THAT TRANSFORMATION
MR. ROH'S STRATEGISTS SAY KOREANS HAVE TEN TIMES MORE TELEVISION SETS SOME TEN MILLION THAN IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
THUS A RECENT KIM YOUNG SAM RALLY THAT ATTRACTED A CROWD OF ONE MILLION AT HIS HOME TOWN OF PUSAN WAS A SECONDARY NEWS ITEM ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS
SEVERAL SMALLER PARTY MEETINGS ATTENDED BY MR. ROH LED THE BROADCAST
ROBERTSON REMAINS THE BIGGEST THREAT ON THE RIGHT AS KEMP STRUGGLES TO SURVIVE
THE RELIGIOUS BROADCASTER HOPES FOR A SURPRISE SHOWING IN ONE OF BUSH'S HOME STATES MAINE
BUT IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE FAILS TO WIN THE BACKING OF FUNDAMENTALISTS SURROUNDING BOB JONES UNIVERSITY THEY LOOK ASKANCE AT CHARISMATIC PRACTICES SUCH AS SPEAKING IN TONGUES
I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
NAVY WARSHIPS AND AIRCRAFT SEARCHED FOR A MISSING U. S. HELICOPTER IN THE SOUTHERN PERSIAN GULF AS IRAN ATTACKED TWO COMMERCIAL VESSELS
THE GUNSHIP CARRYING TWO CREW MEMBERS FAILED TO RETURN TO A CRUISER FOLLOWING MONDAY'S RAIDS ON IRANIAN OIL PLATFORMS AND VESSELS
THE PENTAGON ALSO SAID SEVERAL MINES WERE FOUND IN THE AREA
THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE DOLLAR'S NEW FOUND STRENGTH
THEY SEE IT AS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR CONDUCT OF MONETARY POLICY IT REDUCES THE THREAT OF INFLATION AND EASES PRESSURE FOR FURTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASES
ECONOMIST DAVID HALE SAYS THE DOLLAR'S STRENGTH IS DIMMING THE PROSPECT OF AN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION AS WELL AS AN EIGHTY EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
THE DAX INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT FOUR NINE TO TWELVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO
AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE MONTH LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
BANKS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES *EXCLUDED* FROM THE PRIVATE TALKS
STEPHEN D. SUSMAN ONE OF THE HUNTS' LEAD ATTORNEYS SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL HE STARTED HEARING THE OTHER BANKS' OBJECTIONS
BUT MR. SUSMAN SAID HE ISN'T TROUBLED BY THE MEETINGS
IT SEEMS LIKE GOOD SENSE TO ME
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN LITIGATION OUGHT TO BE TALKING TO PEOPLE TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT HE SAID
THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL
AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CONTRAS
WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER MEDIUM AND LONG RANGE FINANCING SAYS MR. BLAKELY
IN FACT WE JUST REVIEWED THIS SUBJECT AND DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR
STILL HE ADDS I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR HIGHER RATES IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER
AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM
THE SKY ISN'T FALLING SAYS ROBERT GERARD THE HEAD OF MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INCORPORATED'S MUNICIPAL FINANCE DIVISION
SECURITIES UNDERWRITING ISN'T THE ANSWER FOR ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL LOANS
THE JOURNAL'S CLIFFORD KRAUSS LAST MONTH DESCRIBED THE DEEP ANTIPATHY AMONG THE LOCAL POPULATION TOWARD THE POLICIES AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES OF THE SANDINISTAS' INTERNAL TRADE MINISTRY
IN THE AMERICAS COLUMN PUBLISHED ON THIS PAGE LAST FRIDAY DOUGLAS PAYNE DESCRIBED NICARAGUA'S GROWING ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH THE SOVIET BLOC
AND YESTERDAY ON THE WASHINGTON POST'S OP ED PAGE LA PRENSA PUBLISHER VIOLETA CHAMORRO DESCRIBED THE EXTENT OF PRESS CENSORSHIP
THE REACTION FROM THE FREE WORLD SHE WROTE AND THE LEADERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN LITTLE
FINE ANSWERED HIS FRIEND JOHN REILLY
WHO CAN YOU TELL <NOISE>
CERTAINLY NOT THE PUBLIC MR. REILLY NOW SAYS WITH A CHUCKLE
GOD YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW <NOISE>
MERCEDES BENZ OF NORTH AMERICA INITIATED STANDARD DRIVER SIDE AIR BAGS ON ALL ITS U. S. MODELS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
LAST YEAR FOUR OTHER FOREIGN AUTO MAKERS MADE THE EQUIPMENT STANDARD ON SOME OF THEIR MODELS
THOSE COMPANIES INCLUDE THE ACURA DIVISION OF HONDA MOTOR CORPORATION B. M. W. OF NORTH AMERICA INCORPORATED VOLVO OF AMERICA CORPORATION AND PORSCHE CARS OF NORTH AMERICA
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
MARKEL CORPORATION OFFERING OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND COMMON SHARES
OF THE TOTAL SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES WILL BE SOLD BY THE COMPANY AND THE BALANCE VIA SMITH BARNEY HARRIS UPHAM AND COMPANY AND ALEX
BROWN AND SONS INCORPORATED
IN THE EVENT THIS DANGER WAS AVERTED
AFTER RECOVERING PART OF ITS LOSS IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER OCTOBER NINETEENTH THE MARKET SPUTTERED OUT THE YEAR WITH A PERSISTING SENSE OF CRISIS
IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY THE WORLD CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED MASSIVELY TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR AND BACKED UP THE INTERVENTIONS WITH ADJUSTMENTS IN BASIC MONETARY POLICY
THE TREASURY BUNDESBANK RIFT WAS OBVIOUSLY RESOLVED AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION RESTORED
THE SENSE OF CRISIS DISSIPATED AND THE MARKET STARTED THE GRADUAL CLIMB TO ITS CURRENT LEVELS
IN SOME CASES CONSUMERS CAN CHOOSE AMONG AS MANY AS FIFTEEN GENERIC VERSIONS OF A BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG
WE AREN'T PICKING ON ANY PARTICULAR MANUFACTURER SAID IRENE CARO ACTING F. D. A. DISTRICT DIRECTOR IN LOS ANGELES
WE ARE JUST SELECTING A RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE MAKING THESE GENERIC PRODUCTS
PERRY LEVINE HAS SAID HE WOULD RETIRE ONCE A SUCCESSOR HAS BEEN FOUND
JEFFREY LEVINE IS ON LEAVE FROM THE BOARD
NEITHER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME
THIS VARIABILITY IN FIT HAS ALSO BEEN EVIDENT IN THE MERGERS OF OTHER SOUTHEASTERN BANKING COMPANIES
EACH BANKING COMPANY YOU MENTIONED HAS MOVED TO PLACE ITS EXECUTIVES IN KEY POLICY JOBS IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF CULTURE POLICY AND PROCEDURES TO ACQUIRED BANKS
IN EACH CASE THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURES OF OFFICERS OF THE MERGED BANKS EXTENDING TO FORMER C. E. O.S IN SOME INSTANCES
BORDER SKIRMISHES ARE PERIODIC
THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE ENGAGED IN A CONVENTIONAL ARMS RACE THAT HAS DRAGGED IN THE U. S. AND THE SOVIET UNION
INDIA AND PAKISTAN ALSO FEAR THE OTHER'S NUCLEAR POLICIES
THE U. S. CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING A FOUR POINT OH TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFENSE AND ECONOMIC AID PACKAGE FOR PAKISTAN
THE SOVIET UNION HAS ASSURED NEW DELHI THAT ANY CONVENTIONAL WEAPON IN ITS ARSENAL IS AVAILABLE TO INDIA
FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
SO HOME EQUITY LOANS SEEM ALMOST SURE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN CONSUMER BORROWING FOR SOME YEARS TO COME
THE PACE OF LENDING MAY SLOW AS CONSUMERS COMPLETE THE PROCESS OF SUBSTITUTING ONE FORM OF BORROWING FOR ANOTHER
AND WHO KNOWS CONSUMERS MAY FINALLY GET A LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR BORROWING
THE DIRECTORS DIDN'T INDICATE WHAT THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL BE ON THE SPLIT SHARES
THE COMPANY HAS BEEN PAYING FORTY CENTS QUARTERLY ON PRE SPLIT SHARES
THE LAST SUCH DIVIDEND WHICH WAS DECLARED JULY SECOND WILL BE PAID SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIRST TO SHARES OF RECORD AUGUST THIRTY FIRST
THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
THE BOARD HAS DECIDED NOT TO APPOINT A SECOND SPEAKER TO TAKE MY PLACE
MR. HERRHAUSEN WILL CONTINUE ALONE MR. CHRISTIANS SAID YESTERDAY AT THE BANK'S BRANCH HERE
HE IS STEPPING DOWN AFTER HAVING PASSED THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF SIXTY FIVE
MACY IS OFFERING SEVENTY SEVEN POINT THREE DOLLARS A SHARE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF FEDERATED'S SHARES PLUS STOCK IN A COMBINED FEDERATED MACY FOR THE REMAINDER
THE STOCK COMPONENT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL BID WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY ESTIMATED AT ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
MACY'S ADVISERS HOWEVER PRIVATELY VALUE IT AT BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS A SHARE OR COMPARABLE TO CAMPEAU'S PROPOSAL
MR. MAUCHER SAID HE HAD DISCUSSED SOME FORM OF STRATEGIC COOPERATION WITH ROWNTREE'S MR. DIXON FOR THE PAST YEAR
MR. MAUCHER DECLINED TO ELABORATE EXCEPT TO SAY HIS PROPOSALS FELL SHORT OF A TAKEOVER BID
HE SAID HE UNSUCCESSFULLY RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION AGAIN WITH MR. DIXON AFTER THE JACOBS SUCHARD RAID TWO WEEKS AGO
AT THAT POINT NESTLE DECIDED TO LAUNCH ITS BID MR. MAUCHER SAID
THE SHOCKER WAS THAT THE JUDGE HAD ORDERED A HUGE DAMAGE PAYMENT BEFORE CARBIDE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES IF ANY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AT A TRIAL
AT FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST THE DECISION SEEMS TO VIOLATE ANY DEFENDANT'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AGAINST IT
A CARBIDE SPOKESMAN HAS DECRIED THE RULING AS A JUDGMENT AND A DECREE WITHOUT TRIAL
THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WARNER AND LORIMAR AGREED IN MAY TO MERGE IN A STOCK SWAP VALUED AT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS
CHRIS CRAFT INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED WARNER'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER HAS FILED SUIT TO DELAY THE MERGER CHARGING THAT IT VIOLATES CHRIS CRAFT'S SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT WITH WARNER
NEVERTHELESS WARNER HAS SAID IT PLANS TO PROCEED WITH THE MERGER ANYWAY
THE LAST TIME A JAPANESE NONGOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION SOLD STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE U. S. WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ACCORDING TO SECURITIES DATA CORPORATION
IN JULY NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE CORPORATION WHICH IS GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED RAISED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF TEN YEAR NOTES
TO RAISE MEDIUM TERM DEBT JAPANESE COMPANY'S HAVE MOSTLY USED THE LESS REGULATED EUROMARKETS
EVEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES NESTLE FORESEES HUGE POTENTIAL FOR EXTENDING ITS BRAND NAMES AND HIGHLY PROCESSED PRODUCTS
THE COMPANY IS OPENING SEVEN FACTORIES IN ASIA THIS YEAR AND NEXT
IT THINKS ASIAN SALES NOW THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE COMPANY TOTAL COULD REACH TWENTY PERCENT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES
TRITON LOOKS LIKE A LOVELY BOSTON SNOW A FEW DAYS AFTER A SNOWSTORM MARVELS MR. JOHNSON THE BUSY HEAD OF THE IMAGING TEAM'S TRITON GROUP
YOU SEE PILES OF WHITE SNOW AND PATCHES WHERE THE DIRT SHOWS THROUGH
MAYBE TRITON IS MORE LIKE A HUGE COMET THAN A MODEL FOR EARLY EARTH HE SPECULATES
HE WAS A DIGGER THEN BUT HE FOUND THIS DIAMOND LYING ON THE GROUND
HE FELL ON IT SPEECHLESS IN HIS EXCITEMENT CLUTCHING IT IN HIS FIST
HIS FELLOW DIGGERS AT FIRST FEARED MR. SCHALL HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
THE SPOKESWOMAN DECLINED TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE USES FOR THE COMPANY'S CASH OTHER THAN THE STOCK BUYBACK
BUT GARY SCHNEIDER ANALYST WITH BEAR STEARNS AND CO. SAID HE EXPECTS THE COMPANY TO EXTEND THE BUYBACK BEYOND FOUR MILLION SHARES
HE ESTIMATED THE COMPANY'S BREAKUP VALUE AT SEVENTY DOLLARS A SHARE
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OCCASIONALLY MOUTHED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PRIVATE EXPRESS STATUTES THE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT FREE CHOICE IN MAIL SERVICE BUT HAS DONE LITTLE ASIDE FROM TALK
THE WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED EARLIER LAST YEAR TO STOP THE POSTAL SERVICE FROM BANNING PRIVATE COMPANIES FROM SHIPPING BUNDLES OF LETTERS OVERSEAS TO BE DEPOSITED DIRECTLY IN FOREIGN MAIL SYSTEMS
BUT THIS WAS FAIRLY MINOR
PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INC. RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
LIVESTOCK AND MEATS INCREASED DEMAND FROM RETAILERS AND MEATPACKERS BOOSTED CATTLE FUTURE PRICES
THE DECEMBER CONTRACT ROSE ONE POINT OH SEVEN CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX TWO CENTS AT THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE
HOWEVER ANALYSTS DON'T EXPECT THE RISE IN PRICES WHICH BEGAN LATE LAST WEEK TO BE SUSTAINED ONCE RETAILERS AND PACKERS MEET THEIR NEEDS
IT IS DOUBTFUL BEEF WILL SUPPORT THIS PRICE AFTER THIS WEEK SAID JERRY ABBENHAUS AN ANALYST AT A. G. EDWARDS AND SONS INC. IN SAINT LOUIS
HOG FUTURES WERE MIXED AS LOWER CASH PRICES AND A FAIRLY LARGE DELIVERY OF ANIMALS TO SLAUGHTER WEIGHED AGAINST THE DECEMBER CONTRACT
PORK BELLY PRICES FELL
IT IS OUR ROLE IN THE STRUGGLE AS A CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION TO SHOW THAT THE FREEDOM CHARTER IS NOT A COMMUNIST DOCUMENT HE SAYS
THE FREEDOM CHARTER SAYS EXACTLY WHAT JESUS SAID
IT IS CLEAR JESUS WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE POOR OF THE OPPRESSED
THUS LESLEY ASKS CAN THERE BE ANY DOUBT THAT JESUS IS ALSO ON THE SIDE OF THE A. N. C.
<NOISE> EQUICOR WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BY EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORP. TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND TO MANAGE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS FOR CORPORATIONS
AFTER POSTING TWO YEARS OF LOSSES IT BROKE EVEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR
EXECUTIVES OF BOTH EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORP. SAID THEY EXPECT THE VENTURE TO BE PROFITABLE THIS YEAR
FELDMUEHLE SHARES ROSE SIXTEEN MARKS YESTERDAY ON FRANKFURT'S STOCK EXCHANGE TO THREE HUNDRED NINE POINT FIVE MARKS
BROKERS CITED STRONG FOREIGN DEMAND WHICH DROVE UP TRADING VOLUME IN FELDMUEHLE TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES NEARLY FOUR TIMES RECENT LEVELS
BUT THE BROKERS SAID THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ONLY ONE PARTY WAS ACCUMULATING MOST OF THE SHARES
KODAK MAKES A BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY MOSTLY FOR ITSELF
IT SELLS ABOUT TWO MILLION POUNDS TO SIX U. S. DISTRIBUTORS WHO RESELL TO OTHERS
KODAK KNOWS THE IDENTITY OF THE END USERS OF ONE MILLION POUNDS BUT IT CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE REST
HOECHST CELANESE SELLS ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TO DOZENS OF DISTRIBUTORS A SPOKESMAN SAYS
IN SOME INSTANCES WE KNOW WHO THE DISTRIBUTOR SELLS TO THE SPOKESMAN SAYS
IN SOME CASES WE DON'T
REACTING TO THE EROSION OF CONFUCIAN VALUES MANY KOREANS ARE TURNING TO RELIGION ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANITY

MANY ANTI GOVERNMENT ANTI AMERICAN STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT TO THE BEAT OF TRADITIONAL KOREAN DRUMS
STILL THE NEU:RAL NETWORK REPRESENTS A REMARKABLE CONCEPTUAL LEAP IN THE COMPUTER WORLD
IT IS A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCK IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUCH AS THE NEURONS IN HUMANS ARE THE VEHICLE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION
THE NETWORK HAS ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO CREATE THE FIRST CONVINCING LIKENESS OF THE BRAIN IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY AND VISION
THE SUIT CHARGES THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISEES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
THE FRANCHISEES FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES
LAST WEEK HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS SETTLED ON THE HOUSE FINANCING PLAN
BUT WHEN THE HOUSE SENATE COMPROMISE WAS TAKEN UP ON THE HOUSE FLOOR YESTERDAY A LETTER FROM PRESIDENT BUSH WAS WAITING
IF THE CONFERENCE REPORT IS PRESENTED TO ME IN ITS CURRENT FORM HE WROTE I WILL VETO THE BILL
<NOISE> FRANK ROBINSON THE HALL OF FAME HITTER WHO'S THE O'S MANAGER TAKES A LIKE TACK
WE'RE NO POWERHOUSE BUT WE'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES SAYS HE
IF WE CAN KEEP THAT UP WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
IN FRANKFURT PRICES CLOSED MIXED TO HIGHER IN LIVELY TRADING
STOCKS OPENED MUCH FIRMER BUT WERE BROUGHT LOWER BY A WAVE OF PROFIT TAKING
ELECTRONICS COMPANIES SIEMENS NIXDORF AND A. E. G. ALL CLOSED HIGHER
AUTO MAKERS WERE MIXED WITH DAIMLER BENZ CLOSING SLIGHTLY DOWN BUT VOLKSWAGEN B. M. W. AND PORSCHE RISING
IN SOME SECTORS THOUGH INTRIGUING OPTIONS ARE SPRINGING UP
INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR MAJOR BROKERAGES SCREEN MONEY MANAGERS FOR POTENTIAL CLIENTS
SEVERAL HAVE CREATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT POOL THE MONEY OF INVESTORS WITH SIMILAR INVESTMENT GOALS
THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE THEN MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS
<NOISE> ANNUAL FEES FOR SUCH ACCOUNTS HOWEVER OFTEN RUN AS HIGH AS THREE PERCENT INCLUDING TRANSACTION COSTS
HIS ANSWER RAISE THE TEMPERATURE ARTIFICIALLY IN THE MORNING BY JOGGING OR WITH A HOT DRINK
BREAKFAST ALSO HELPS AS DOES JUMPING INTO A HOT SHOWER ON AWAKENING
AT THE OPPOSITE END MORNING PEOPLE TAKE NAPS
A FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTE NAP AT TWO OR THREE P. M. WILL GIVE THEM MORE ENERGY
ROBERT H. SEWELL CHAIRMAN OF EQUITABLE BANKSHARES INC. A SMALL DALLAS BASED BANK HOLDING COMPANY WAS ASTONISHED AT THE OPULENCE
I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS BANK FURNITURE HE SAYS
BANKERS DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF STUFF
NEVERTHELESS HE ARRIVED WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASHIER'S CHECKS ENOUGH HE FIGURES TO OUTFIT HALF OF TWO NEW BRANCHES
USUALLY HE CALCULATES HE WOULD SPEND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUY THAT MUCH FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT
HE ALSO WAS IN THE MARKET FOR AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES AND OTHER BANKING EQUIPMENT
BUT REPRESENTATIVE SOLARZ PLANS TO TRY AGAIN THIS WEEK
AND OTHER CONGRESSMEN ARE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL ASSURANCES THAT PAKISTAN WON'T MAKE A BOMB
SENATOR JOHN GLENN DEMOCRAT OF OHIO IS EXPECTED TO INTRODUCE A SIMILAR ENRICHMENT AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE
SOME CONGRESSMEN HAVE SUGGESTED GRANTING THE WAIVER BUT FOR ONLY ONE OR TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX
LATELY CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS OR AT LEAST INVESTORS APPEAR TO PREFER BOOKS AND CRAFTS

AFTER WATCHING EVANGELICAL T. V. MINISTERS NORMAN LEAR BEGAN SPENDING HIS FORTUNE ON A GROUP CALLED PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY
MUCH OF THIS SWAMP CREATURE TREATMENT CAME TO A HEAD IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LAWSUITS OVER CREATIONISM AND SECULAR HUMANISM IN SCHOOL TEXTS
THE ESTABLISHMENT MADE VIRTUALLY NO EFFORT TO PUSH BELOW THE SURFACE OF THESE GRIEVANCES
LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND CO. DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
MONARCH CAPITAL ROSE TWO TO FORTY ONE AND THREE QUARTERS
THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING ONE MILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES SAID IT WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE MILLION SHARES
MONARCH HAS ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
BUT AN AMERICAN BRANDS SPOKESMAN SAYS WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE INDENTURES WHICH DON'T PROHIBIT ASSET SALES IF THEY ARE AT FAIR VALUE
HE ADDS WE KEPT SAYING ALL ALONG WE WEREN'T GOING TO ASSUME OR GUARANTEE THE E. TWO BONDS
IN FACT THE COVER OF AMERICAN BRANDS' OFFER DOCUMENT SAID IT DIDN'T INTEND TO ASSUME OR GUARANTEE THEM
THROUGH VAGUENESS MR. DUKAKIS AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DISGUISED THE TRUE COSTS OF THEIR BUDGET BUSTING PROPOSALS

INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS

FED OFFICIALS SOUND RELUCTANT TO EASE CREDIT FURTHER FOR NOW DESPITE SPECULATION OF A DISCOUNT RATE CUT
I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING PRETTY WELL SAYS ONE MEMBER OF THE FED'S OPEN *MARKET* COMMITTEE

THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK

IT WAS A STATEMENT

WHILE FORMER EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS FACE JAIL FOR NON CRIMES CONGRESS IS ABUSING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN SEEKING IMMUNITY FROM LIBEL SUITS
THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D. C. CIRCUIT HELD LAST NOVEMBER THAT CONGRESSMEN CAN BE SUED FOR STATEMENTS MADE OUTSIDE CONGRESS

THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER VEHICLES FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS

I THOUGHT I'D BE IN A HECK OF A LOT BETTER POSITION BY NOW HE SAYS
BEFORE THE DROUGHT I THOUGHT WE HAD A GOOD SHOT AT A GOOD YEAR
THE BOND *ISSUANCE* PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL
AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEARED STALLED ANALYSTS SAID
IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR
THE LACK OF MARKET DEPTH YESTERDAY ENABLED SEVERAL LARGE BUY ORDERS TO SPARK THE DOLLAR RALLY
ONE NEW YORK TRADER SAID HE WITNESSED THE CURRENCY'S VALUE JUMP AS HIS BANK EXECUTED A PURCHASE ORDER FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SEVERAL CHUNKS
WHEN THERE ARE VERY FEW PLAYERS THAT KIND OF ORDER WILL MOVE THE MARKET SAID THE TRADER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAID IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR
THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
S:OME EXPERTS SAY THAT BECAUSE OF SWEEPING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY COULDN'T BE RE REGULATED EVEN IF PEOPLE WANTED
BUT THE CONTINUING DECONTROL OF THIS AREA ALSO SHOWS THAT THE REGULATORY RESURGENCY IS SELECTIVE
WHILE RULES ARE REVIVED TO DEAL WITH PUBLICIZED CONCERNS SUCH AS AIR AND RAIL SAFETY THE GOVERNMENT PULLBACK CONTINUES IN SUCH AREAS AS CONSUMER PROTECTION AND ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT
TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
THE IRAN CONTRA COMMITTEE ENDED ITS HEARINGS YESTERDAY IN A TORRENT OF MEMBERS' SPEECHES ABOUT LIES AND DECEIT
CONGRESS NOW TURNS TO ITS REWRITE OF THE GRAMM RUDMAN LAW WHICH HAS TARGETED THE FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DEFICIT AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
THE TARGET WILL BE RAISED BECAUSE MEMBERS IT SEEMS ARE NOT PREPARED TO KEEP THE SPENDING CUT PROMISES MADE WHEN IT WAS SET
NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
THEY POINT TO THE RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT THREE FOUR PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE *INCREASE* WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
BRAZIL UNILATERALLY STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FOREIGN BANK DEBTS LAST FEBRUARY TWENTIETH
IT CITED WEAKENED FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD RESERVES
SINCE THEN ITS MEDIUM TERM AND LONG TERM FOREIGN BANK DEBT HAS CLIMBED TO MORE THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING INTEREST ARREARS
SO FAR THE EXECUTIVE SAYS HE HAS SIGNED UP FIFTY TWO FIELD ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AGENTS
BY YEAR'S END HE EXPECTS HIS AGENT INVESTOR GROUP COULD NUMBER TWO THOUSAND
HE ALSO HAS LURED THREE FORMER EXECUTIVES WHO WORKED WITH HIM AT I. T. T.'S UNIT
ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
A MERGER WITH MACY WHICH IS ROUGHLY HALF THE SIZE OF FEDERATED COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE LARGER RETAILER'S EXECUTIVES
MACY'S SMALLER SIZE COULD LEAVE FEDERATED'S OFFICERS WITH OPERATING POWER IN A COMBINED CONCERN
AND FEELINGS AT FEDERATED HAVE RUN HIGH AGAINST CAMPEAU WHICH SURPRISED THE COMPANY WITH A HOSTILE BID LAST MONTH
<NOISE> HOWEVER CAMPEAU'S BID IS ALL CASH AND THE MACY BID ISN'T
INSTITUTIONALIZING AUDITING WOULD ALSO HELP REDUCE TAX EVASION

<NOISE> BUT AMERICAN EXPRESS INSISTS IT HAS NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT
THE ANSWER IS NO
NOT WHILE I'M HERE SAYS EDWIN COOPERMAN PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS'S CONSUMER CARD GROUP
THE SAME MENTALITY AFFECTED THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE STORES MR. GARCIA SAID
HE OWNS THIRTY SEVEN BURGER KINGS IN FLORIDA BUT HE REFUSES TO PUT UP THE BUILDING THAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY BURGER KING
IT LOOKS LIKE A MATCHBOX
SOCIALIST REVOLUTION THE CARD READ
THE STUDENTS FLASH A COLORFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE KOREAN FLAG
AND THEN IN A PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED MOVE LONG LIVE THE *GREAT* LEADER KIM IL SUNG
THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE AN S. SOUND
A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
HOLIDAY WAS ALSO *VULNERABLE* BECAUSE IT HADN'T MUCH CHANGED AND CONSUMERS HAD
THEY WERE MORE SOPHISTICATED AND WIDELY TRAVELED
THEY DEMANDED MORE INSTEAD OF GETTING BETTER MANY HOLIDAY INNS HAD GONE DOWNHILL
SOME WERE QUITE *VEHEMENT* IN RESISTING ANY CHANGE
IF A COMPANY DID THIS I WOULDN'T FOLLOW THEM ANYMORE SAID ONE NEW YORK ANALYST
ISSUERS OF ABBREVIATED ANNUAL REPORTS ARE REALLY SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR THE TYPICAL SHAREHOLDER SAID ANOTHER
THE U. S. COTTON INDUSTRY IS COST COMPETITIVE WITH THE MAJOR PRODUCING COUNTRIES BUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FOREIGN COTTON PRODUCED IS SUBSIDIZED

THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE *EXCESSIVELY* EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS

REFLECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE POUND BRITISH BOND FUNDS PERFORMED BEST AS A GROUP WITH A SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT MEDIAN RETURN
FUNDS HEAVILY INVESTED IN U. S. AND SWISS BONDS YIELDED THE QUARTER'S POOREST RETURNS
BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
CURRENCY LOSSES ALSO COULD EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH *ECONOMISTS* EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR

THE LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS BASED RETAILER SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO RETIRE DEBT TO FINANCE OPERATIONS AND FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES

CONGRESS ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS OWN ABILITY TO PROTECT SECRETS
CURRENT PROCEDURES ALMOST REQUIRE AN OPERATION'S COVER TO BE BLOWN BEFORE THE OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE
IF CONGRESS HAD *ADEQUATE* SECURITY LAWS AND PROCEDURES WITH STIFF PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THE END RESULT PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE FRANK DISCUSSION NOT LESS
BUT THE PROPOSAL BY TEXACO'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS WHICH COULD LEAD TO HISTORY'S LARGEST ACQUISITION INVOLVES NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES

ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AR- AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
MOST ANALYSTS SAID THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OF THE TWO BANKS MADE A GOOD FIT

INDEED A DETAILED ANALYSIS CITES SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS
SOLID USER DEMAND GENERATED BY HONG KONG'S ROBUST ECONOMY AND RISING INCOMES IS ONE FACTOR
ANOTHER IS HEAVY INVESTMENT INFLOWS FROM JAPAN *AUSTRALIA* NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND TAIWAN

THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL BURKE AN ANALYST AT LONDON *STOCKBROKERS* KLEINWORT *GRIEVESON* SECURITIES

IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. *BUSH* IS USING A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON THE DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME *REPUBLI-* -(RE)!PUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT

MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS

ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF CHIEF OF STAFF DUBERSTEIN EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
THERE ARE TOO MANY CASES WHERE CUSTOMS OFFICERS HAVE GIVEN THEIR OPINION THE CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS
THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE SERVICE

THE PAYMENT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES APPARENTLY BOUGHT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE DREXEL FINANCING AND A PROMISSORY NOTE
BROOKS ITSELF BORROWED MONEY TO FUND THE THIRTY MILLION CASH PORTION
BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THE FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
BALLY'S DRIVE INTO THE HOTEL CASINO INDUSTRY HAS MADE HEALTH CLUBS AN INC:REASINGLY AWKWARD FIT ANALYSTS SAID AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DIVESTITURE
BY SHEDDING THE HEALTH CLUB LINE BALLY COULD FOCUS ON ITS REMAINING OPERATIONS GAMBLING MACHINES STATE LOTTERIES AND AMUSEMENT CENTERS
ANALYSTS ALSO QUESTION THE FIT OF THE COMPANY'S THEME PARKS THOUGH SAYING A SALE OF THAT OPERATION COULD FOLLOW

IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE
K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS
THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE

<NOISE> NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED

<NOISE> SEVERAL NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE ON TAKEOVERS ALSO APPEAR DOOMED
BUT OTHERS NOTABLY WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISERS PRESSED ON
WE FELT THAT THE FUTURES MARKET REFLECTED ACTUAL TRADING LEVELS AT THE TIME SAYS FRED GRAUER THE HEAD OF THE WELLS FARGO AND COMPANY SUBSIDIARY
MANY STOCK PRICES HADN'T BEEN UPDATED IN SEVERAL MINUTES HE EXPLAINS AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT SUBSEQUENT STOCK TRADES WOULD BE AT EVEN LOWER LEVELS
BY DAY'S END WELLS SOLD FOURTEEN THOUSAND FUTURE CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS
<NOISE> THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
STAN WEINSTEIN THE EDITOR OF THE PROFESSIONAL TAPE READER WHICH ALSO RANKED NEAR THE BOTTOM IN THE SURVEY DISAGREES WITH SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MR. HULBERT'S RANKING METHOD
FOR EXAMPLE MR. WEINSTEIN DISLIKES THE WAY MR. HULBERT CALCULATES ENTRY AND EXIT PRICES
HE SAYS MR. HULBERT SHOULD USE PRICES MIDWAY IN MR. WEINSTEIN'S RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR STOCK PURCHASES OR SALES
MR. HULBERT CUSTOMARILY USES MARKET PRICES EITHER THE OPENING PRICE OR THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR THE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE
IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
<NOISE> MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD

I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
<NOISE> ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS

U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EITHER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
A MAN WHO DOES THIS THE CONGRESSMAN PROFESSES TO BELIEVE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
<NOISE> CERTAINLY HE CAN'T ASSOCIATE WITH THE BOY SCOUTS WHO INHABIT CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOMS
OFF WITH HIS HEAD
A RECENT VOTING STUDY BY THE COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE TRIES TO MEASURE WHAT CONGRESSMEN ACTUALLY DO TO LOWER COMPETITIVE BARRIERS AND END CORPORATE SUBSIDIES <NOISE> NOT WHAT THEY SAY
IN THE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS THE AVERAGE HOUSE MEMBER VOTED WITH C. E. I. ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE TIME
MEMBERS OF THE COMPETITIVENESS CAUCUS FARED WORSE THAN THE HOUSE AS A WHOLE THEIR AVERAGE SCORE WAS ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT
G. O. P. REPRESENTATIVE TOM DELAY OF TEXAS CALLS THEM MEMBERS OF THE PROTECTIONIST CAUCUS
WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS ON IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
<NOISE> THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN <NOISE> BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN SOME KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT TO WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
IN SHORT THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE AYATOLLAH WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW
TWO PORTALS INSTEAD OF ONE HEADED BY TWO FINE SCIENTISTS MAY MEAN SPEEDIER HANDLING OF NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS DOCTOR JENNINGS SAID

A CONTROL GROUP IN THE STUDY WILL RECEIVE A SMALLPOX VACCINE
BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT

BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONG OTHER THINGS
MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES
BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP BURNUP AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST
BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COMPANIES WERE EXCHANGING SUITS THAT HAVE LINGERED IN THE COURTS EVER SINCE
MERITOR ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR *TO* MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
ITS DEPOSITS ARE STILL INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON WHY MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
OTHER ENTRANTS OFFER SUCH PEN NAMES AS GRANNY MR. DISCUSSION ANNA DARLING DEAR JOHN AND BEA READY

NOWHERE IS THE SHOCK GREATER THAN IN TOWNS LIKE OBERHAUSEN IN THE RUHR VALLEY WEST GERMANY'S INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND
HERE UNLIKE IN MOST OF EUROPE THE INDUSTRY REMAINS IN PRIVATE HANDS AND BOASTS SOME OF THE MOST MODERN PLANTS TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE
<NOISE> NOT ONLY ARE THEY EFFICIENT THEY HAVE SHIFTED OVER THE YEARS TO THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY SPECIALTY STEELS THAT BRING HIGHER PROFIT MARGINS
THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK <NOISE> OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
THE THREE DIRECTORS WERE AMONG FIVE WHO REJECTED THE LEBOW OFFER WITH THREE INSIDE DIRECTORS ABSTAINING
THEY HAD SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY WOULD FAVOR AN ACQUISITION UPON TERMS WHICH WERE INDEPENDENTLY APPRAISED AS FAIR BY ALL SHAREHOLDERS
THEY REJECTED THE EARLIER OFFER BECAUSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION WAS UNABLE TO RENDER A FAIRNESS OPINION

MR. FORBES SAID HE'D HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
I ASSURE YOU THAT FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
MR. FORBES ALSO SAID THAT HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TALKS SURPRISED ANALYSTS AND FAILED TO IMPRESS INVESTORS
BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES FELL TWENTY FIVE PENCE OR FORTY FOUR CENTS TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE PENCE IN LATE TRADING YESTERDAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE

<NOISE> LOOK AT THE PALESTINIANS THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS FOR FORTY YEARS HE SAID
THEY HAVEN'T ACHIEVED WHAT SEVEN DIVIDED AFGHAN PARTIES HAVE ACHIEVED IN EIGHT YEARS
IF THE RESISTANCE FEUDS OVER POWER ONCE THE KABUL REGIME FALLS HE SAID I COULDN'T CARE LESS
<NOISE> AT FIRST THE REBELS TRIED TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THEIR HOME GROWN MULES
BUT THESE ANIMALS WERE A SCRAWNY LOT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS AND WHEN THEY WEREN'T WORKED TO DEATH THEY WERE GUNNED DOWN BY THE SOVIETS
THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES
THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE
THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY
THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE
SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED

IT PROVIDED FOR INSTANCE THE LARGEST SLICE OF THE RECORD SEVENTY SIX MILLION ESTIMATED GROSS FROM THE RECENT SUGAR RAY LEONARD MARVIN HAGLER BOUT
MEANWHILE YOUNG HEAVYWEIGHT SENSATION MIKE TYSON PROMISES TO GENERATE CLOSED CIRCUIT QUALITY FIGHTS FOR YEARS TO COME
<NOISE> HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
BUT THE ORDER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GENERATED INTENSE CONTROVERSY BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CABINET

<NOISE> IN SEPTEMBER THE PRESIDENT'S MOST POWERFUL ADVISER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY JOKER ARROYO TOLD CONGRESS THAT MR. ONGPIN TRICKED MRS. AQUINO INTO SIGNING THE ORDER
TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND

BASED ON THAT PRICE LINCOLN'S COMMON SHARES HAVE A TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS
WE'VE HAD A MAJOR RUN UP LAST WEEK PARTICULARLY FRIDAY NOTED MR. POLCE
BUT HE ADDED THAT THE DOLLAR CAME UP TOO FAST THE MARKET'S BEEN CONSOLIDATING ITS GAINS
MOREOVER MR. POLCE SAID THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE TILL THE JAPANESE TRADE NUMBERS COME OUT
RETAIL SALES ARE A CLOSELY WATCHED INDICATOR OF CONSUMER SPENDING
THEY TOTAL MORE THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT <NOISE> THE VALUE OF ALL THE GOODS AND SERVICES PRODUCED IN THE NATION
BUT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S MONTHLY ESTIMATE BASED ON EARLY REPORTS FROM RETAILERS FREQUENTLY IS REVISED SUBSTANTIALLY
THE FIGURES ARE ADJUSTED FOR SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS INCLUDING THIS YEAR'S EARLY EASTER BUT NOT FOR INFLATION
BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT DAY ISN'T WORRIED
WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAID
WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
THE EQUITY PEOPLE AND THE FUTURES PEOPLE HAVE JOINT AND MUTUAL INTERESTS SAID RICHARD L. SANDOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED IN CHICAGO
I APPLAUD THE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO GET SOME JOINT ACTION
IT'S A MILESTONE IN THAT REGARD
BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
<NOISE> I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
IN MY MINISTRY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALTERNATIVES OF INDEPENDENCE
THERE ARE ALREADY TWO GERMANYS AND TWO KOREAS
BUT AFTER CLOSE STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT INDEPENDENCE IS A DEAD END
WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE US
AND IN THAT CASE WHAT'S THE USE OF DECLARING INDEPENDENCE
THEN IN JUNE CAME A CASE INVOLVING COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ATTEMPTED TO THROW A TUPPERWARE PARTY AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
THEY WERE FORBIDDEN BY UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS WHO CITED RULES PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES ON CAMPUS
THE STUDENTS SUED THE SCHOOL BUT THE SUPREME COURT HELD IN FAVOR OF THE UNIVERSITY BAN
THE BUNDESBANK HAS REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION
THESE DAYS IT'S POSSIBLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERS AND READ ABOUT WEST GERMAN FEARS OF REIGNITING INFLATION
YOU HAVE TO PINCH YOURSELF TO REMEMBER THAT THE INFLATION RUNNING NEAR ZERO IN APRIL IS NOW RUNNING BELOW ZERO
THE E. M. S. APPARENTLY MUST NOW BE REALIGNED AND THE FRANC DEVALUED TO ACCOMMODATE THE GERMAN TASTE FOR DEFLATION
THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US

BANK AID OKLAHOMA SENATOR BOREN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS FROM STATES HARD HIT BY BANK CLOSINGS MULL WAYS TO EASE THE FALLOUT
A MAJOR CONCERN IS A DROP IN REAL ESTATE VALUES WHEN EXTENSIVE LANDHOLDINGS OF FAILED BANKS ARE SOLD
ONE POSSIBLE GOAL A REGIONAL CONSORTIUM TO HELP PROP UP LAND PRICES
THE COMPANY ATTRIBUTED THE EARNINGS INCREASE TO GROWING POPULARITY OF ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM <NOISE> WHICH IS USED WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND COMPATIBLE MODELS

THE SYSTEM FOR THE MACINTOSH WAS INTRODUCED IN AUGUST
THE SUPREME COURT TURNED ITS BACK ON THE BASIC WISDOM OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE LAST APRIL <NOISE> IN THE CASE OF C. T. S. CORPORATION VERSUS
DYNAMICS CORPORATION
THIS WAS THE CASE THAT UPHELD INDIANA'S LAW REGULATING CORPORATE TAKEOVERS WHICH WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN FEDERAL LAW TO PROTECT TARGETS AT THE EXPENSE OF BIDDERS
THE RESULT IS A CRUSH OF ANTI TAKEOVER LAWS IN A DOZEN STATES SO FAR
THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES THE BILL AND NO SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE
THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE'S SUBCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE WILL HOLD HEARINGS ON THE MEASURE LATE THIS YEAR OR EARLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT A SPOKESMAN SAID
CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES SAID THE LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FACE GREATER OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE THAN IN THE HOUSE
NORTHGATE DECLINED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF AN EXPECTED GAIN ON THE SALE
THE COMPANY SAID NET PROCEEDS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE MAINLY USED TO FINANCE GOLD MINING ACQUISITIONS
NORTHGATE SAID IT WILL SEEK PURE GOLD MINES ONLY
OCEAN SPRAY SAYS IT SIMPLY CAN'T SELL PURE CRANBERRY JUICE BECAUSE IT'S TOO TART TASTING

THE SUIT CHARGES THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
THE FRANCHISES FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES

WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I GATHER IS HAPPENING HERE HE SAID
JUST WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE DAM BROKE WHICH LED US TO A RATHER SURPRISING END
<NOISE> COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE SEEKING THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR LINES LENDING TO BLUE CHIP CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DRIED UP
BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
<NOISE> THAT LINE MAY BE WEARING THIN WITH PRIVATE BANKS
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF SOUND POLICY MOVES
OTHERWISE WHY KEEP POURING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD
<NOISE> IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND ACCORD THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ASSERTED THAT THE DOLLAR HAD DECLINED ENOUGH

BRANIFF SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND PAN AM'S UNION EMPLOYEES TWENTY PERCENT IN EXCHANGE FOR WAGE SAVINGS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS
STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
<NOISE> HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
MOREOVER SOME HOUSING SPECIALISTS SAY PERMIT ACTIVITY IS A POOR INDICATOR OF FUTURE STARTS ARGUING THAT IT REFLECTS CURRENT HOUSING ACTIVITY RATHER THAN PREDICTING FUTURE ACTIVITY
THEY PREDICT THAT INSTEAD OF FALLING HOUSING STARTS WILL IMPROVE IN COMING MONTHS IN REACTION TO INCREASING NEW AND EXISTING HOME SALES
ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS TREND WILL BE THE SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS BEEN BATTERED BY RECESSION AND A HOUSING GLUT
AFTER THREE MONTHS ON THE JOB SESSIONS SAYS HIS AGENDA IS JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP
HE HAS INDICATED THAT PRIORITIES WOULD INCLUDE BANK FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND TIGHTENING F. B. I. PROCEDURES FOR UNDERCOVER PROBES
CRITICS SAY THAT UNDER HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH THE F. B. I. FAILED TO DEFEND ITSELF QUICKLY ENOUGH AGAINST RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INVESTIGATIONS
THE TOKYO FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET IS CLOSED ON SATURDAYS

<NOISE> RECENT COVERAGE OF THE CLOSING OF LONG ISLAND LIGHTING COMPANY'S NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BRINGS TO LIGHT A FASCINATING IRONY
<NOISE> THE VICTORY CELEBRATION OF THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE PLANT MAY BE SHORT LIVED
WITHOUT THIS PLANT LONG ISLAND STANDS A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF MAJOR SHORTAGES IN ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES DURING ITS EVER INCREASING PEAK DEMAND PERIODS
<NOISE> THIS LACK OF RELIABILITY WILL BE A SIGNAL TO BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY THAT LONG ISLAND IS NOT A DESIRABLE PLACE TO LOCATE
MEANWHILE LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL TAXPAYERS WILL BE JOINING LILCO RATEPAYERS IN FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE UNUSED FACILITY
THESE SAME RATEPAYERS WILL BE FORCED TO PAY TOP MARKET PRICE FOR ELECTRICITY IMPORTED INTO THEIR SYSTEM
WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE BILLION OF REPORTED STOCK ASSETS THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS CONTROL A SIZABLE CHUNK OF PENSION ASSETS AND PRIVATE PORTFOLIOS
INVESTMENT ADVISERS TEND TO BE SMALL PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHOSE OWNERS MANAGE THE PORTFOLIOS
THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES
AS THE MARKET CONTINUED ITS UPWARD MARCH IN EARLY JANUARY AN ALREADY MEAGER BEAR POPULATION DWINDLED FURTHER
IT'S TOUGH TO FIGHT THE TAPE SAYS STANLEY SALVIGSEN THE STILL BEARISH CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY
THE MARKET HAS BEATEN THE BEARS INTO SUBMISSION
ADDS MICHAEL METZ A MARKET STRATEGIST AT OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY WHO HAS HIMSELF REMAINED BEARISH THERE'S NOTHING THAT'LL CONVERT A BEAR LIKE AN UP MARKET
<NOISE> IT MIGHT BE SAID BY WAY OF REJOINDER THAT CONGRESSIONAL LIBERALS WILL BLITHELY ENACT ALL PROPOSED SOCIAL POLICIES THAT ARE POPULAR AND THEN CUT THE MILITARY BUDGET DRASTICALLY
THIS IS POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY
<NOISE> IT IS A LOT EASIER TO FORM A CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY AGAINST DRASTIC CUTS IN DEFENSE THAN AGAINST RELATIVELY MODEST EXPENDITURES ON PARTICULAR SOCIAL PROGRAMS
MAYBE IT IS SUGGESTED THERE IS AN EASIER WAY
WHAT ABOUT FIBERGLAS GONDOLAS

IN THE LATEST QUARTER NET INTEREST INCOME MARGINS DECLINED TO FOUR POINT EIGHT SEVEN PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT A YEAR AGO
THE DECLINE REFLECTED LOWER LOAN YIELDS AND REDUCED INVESTMENT INCOME AFTER THE SALE OF HIGH YIELDING BONDS IN LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER
IT ALSO REFLECTED THE EFFECT OF TAX OVERHAUL WHICH REDUCED THE BENEFITS OF MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
FIRST UNION HAS ASSETS OF TWENTY FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION
A SPOKESMAN FOR I. M. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE CHARGES
NEITHER OF THE RECAREY BROTHERS NOR MESSRS.

<NOISE> MANY OF THE SOME SIXTY THOUSAND CARS AND TRUCKS WERE DRIVEN FOR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILES
LEE IACOCCA HAS NOW CALLED THIS PRACTICE DUMB AND STUPID
HE HAS A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A NICE MAN
CRITICS SAY HE IS CAPTIVATED BY HIS OWN ELOQUENCE
TRUE HE SAYS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
NINE OF THE TEN DEATHS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS OCCURRED WHEN CHILDREN WERE STRANGLED BY STRINGS USED TO TIE THE PACIFIERS AROUND THEIR NECKS
COMMISSION REGULATIONS PROHIBIT THE SALE OF PACIFIERS WITH STRINGS AND REQUIRE A LABEL WARNING AGAINST THIS PRACTICE
<NOISE> ANY FURTHER EFFORT TO REDUCE THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH PACIFIERS WOULD DIVERT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM GREATER DANGERS AND THE WARNINGS PROBABLY WOULD CAUSE NEEDLESS WORRY
THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
<NOISE> EACH CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE SHARE THAT ISN'T TENDERED WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CASH DOVER SAID
THE OFFER BEGAN TODAY AND IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME JULY TWENTIETH
ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT THE TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
GIVEN THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IT'S A GOOD USE OF THE CASH SAID WILLIAM R. YOUNG AN ANALYST WITH DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED
THEY'RE DEFINITELY UNDERVALUED
FOR A PREMIER CHEMICAL COMPANY TO CARRY SUCH A DISCOUNT NEAR THE END OF AN ECONOMIC CYCLE SEEMS SILLY TO ME
A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS IS ALREADY WREAKING HAVOC IN MANY OF CHINA'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES
A FACTORY THAT MAKES NIKE SHOES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE HAS TO RUN A GENERATOR THREE DAYS A WEEK TO STAY IN OPERATION
<NOISE> THE PLANT'S TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ARE STOCKPILING COAL AND OIL FOR POWER IN CASE THEIR SUPPLIES GET CUT OFF
MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE
RICHARD MACDONALD AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SAID THE RESULTS WERE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
THE IMPRESSIVE THING IS THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE MADE IN COST SAVINGS HE ADDED
FOR EXAMPLE TIME RECENTLY SAID IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH ITS MAGAZINE DEVELOPMENT GROUP A MOVE MR. MACDONALD SAID COULD SHAVE THIRTY MILLION IN ANNUAL COSTS
THE F. S. L. I. C. FUND IS SUPPOSED TO COVER INSURED DEPOSITS OF A HUNDRED AND NINETY BILLION IN THE NATION'S THREE THOUSAND FEDERALLY INSURED THRIFTS
EVEN THE BANK BOARD'S STATED ONE POINT NINE BILLION OF RESERVES IS THE LOWEST RATIO OF RESERVES TO DEPOSITS EVER
ALSO PENDING ARE REQUESTS FOR MORE THAN TWO BILLION IN LOANS TO TROUBLED THRIFTS
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WALK PAST ANYTHING I BELIEVED TO BE WRONG WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING MR. KAGLER SAYS
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YEAH BUT YOU THINK TOO MUCH IS WRONG
MAYBE I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIPLOMATIC
BUT NO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY
I DON'T CHOOSE TO LIVE THIS WAY
EATING IS MY PASTIME AND EATING IN TEXAS IS AN ADVENTURE
BUT LAST FALL MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO CHANGE MY DIET AT LEAST UNTIL I LOWERED MY CHOLESTEROL LEVEL
THE FACILITIES ARE IN BEVERLY AND DANVERS MASSACHUSETTS AND IN CHESHIRE CONNECTICUT
HEALTH AND REHABILITATION IS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST
CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS BASED GREENERY WHICH OWNS NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE TRUST OPERATES NURSING HOMES
THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM
U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND A TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO
MAKING MATTERS WORSE THE HARVEST RIPENING IN THE FIELDS PROMISES TO BE A MONSTER PORTENDING RECORD POST HARVEST SUPPLIES OF CORN AND A GLUT OF OTHER COMMODITIES
TO HELP CUT PRODUCTION THE U. S. IS PAYING FARMERS AN ANNUAL RENT FOR TEN YEARS TO IDLE EROSION PRONE CROP LAND UNDER A CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
WHAT HAPPENS NOW
THAT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS WHETHER MANAGEMENT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE WORKERS AND WHETHER UNION LEADERS CAN CONTROL THE RANK AND FILE
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON EITHER COUNT
INDEED LABOR EXPERTS SAY THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE THAT SOUTH KOREA CAN LAY A FOUNDATION FOR LABOR RELATIONS THAT MIGHT CALM WORKER UNREST SOON
THE DEBARTOLOS BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS HAVE THE FINANCIAL *WHEREWITHAL* TO MAKE A BID FOR ZAYRE
THE FAMILY'S PERSONAL WEALTH IS ESTIMATED AT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND THEY ARRANGED FINANCING FOR THE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR BIDS FOR ALLIED AND CARTER HAWLEY
THE DEBARTOLOS LOST OUT IN THE BIDDING FOR ALLIED AND CAMPEAU CORPORATION A TORONTO REAL ESTATE FIRM
CARTER HAWLEY AVOIDED A TAKEOVER THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING
NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED AT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
ACTION FOR CHILDREN'S TELEVISION IS THE LEAD PARTY IN THE PETITION EVEN THOUGH THE F. C. C. SAID ITS TOUGHER POLICY IS AIMED AT PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM INDECENT FARE
VIOLATING FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISN'T THE WAY TO PROTECT CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY
IT'S LIKE BURNING BOOKS IN A LIBRARY SAID PEGGY CHARREN PRESIDENT OF THE CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS BASED ORGANIZATION
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM OF THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COSTS WHO GETS LESS
DOCTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY AND THEIR INCOMES
HOSPITALS ARE FIGHTING TO HANG ONTO REVENUE MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH COMES FROM MEDICARE
AND PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE SERVICES DECREASE
BUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW CONSUMES ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE AND ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TAMING
ANALYSTS SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THE I. P. O.S ON ONE MARKET MIGHT OUTPERFORM THOSE ON ANOTHER OVER A PARTICULAR PERIOD
FOR ONE THING SMALLER STOCKS HAVE OUTPERFORMED LARGER ISSUES FOR MUCH OF THE SPAN COVERED IN N. A. S. D.'S STATISTICS
SO THAT PROBABLY HELPED THE NEW ISSUES ON THE O. T. C. MARKET WHICH ARE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN THOSE HEADED FOR THE BIG BOARD
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOME GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES C. I. A. HAD TO GIVE UP FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
NOW IT IS SUGGESTED THAT OFFICIALS GIVE UP FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS
IN NINETEEN NINETY SOMEONE IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GIVE UP THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTING THEM FROM UNLAWFUL SEARCHES
WHY NOT
THEY MAY BE HIDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THEIR HOMES
A LOS ANGELES BANKRUPTCY COURT MONDAY APPROVED ARGO'S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS INTEREST IN ARGO'S OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SENECA SAID IT WILL REFINANCE SOME OF THE ARGO DEBT

PACIFIC POWER AND LIGHT IS THE PRINCIPAL UNIT OF PORTLAND OREGON BASED PACIFICORP
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE UTILITY UNIT SAID IN OUR MINDS THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF PREFERENCE WAS LAID TO REST BY THE COURT'S DECISION
THE COMPANY SAID IT EXPECTS TO PREVAIL WHEN THE COMMISSION WEIGHS THE OTHER SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS
THIS IS A VICTORY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ASSERTED THE SPOKESMAN ADDING THAT THE DAM PROVIDES OUR LOWEST COST SOURCE OF POWER
SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED AN INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE CAN EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS
THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE TWENTY FIVE A SHARE
TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICK UP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO GET THESE POLICY CHANGES WITHOUT THE CHAOS OF A DECLINING MARKET SAID HARVARD ECONOMIST LAWRENCE SUMMERS
BUT IF THE MARKET GETS PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ANYWAY IT MIGHT HELP
TO BE SURE THE STOCK CRASH DOES RAISE THE RISK OF RECESSION
THE BENEFITS MENTIONED ABOVE WILL BE OVERWHELMED IF CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES ARE BADLY SHAKEN AND DECIDE TO SHARPLY REDUCE THEIR SPENDING
AN UNUSUALLY WEAK CHRISTMAS BUYING SEASON OR WIDESPREAD SHELVING OF BUSINESS INVESTMENT PLANS COULD EASILY CAUSE THE MARKET'S PROBLEMS TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY
WHETHER THAT HAPPENS DEPENDS FAR MORE ON PSYCHOLOGY THAN ECONOMICS
WE *EMPHATICALLY* REJECT THE IDEA THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SUBVERTED THE LAW UNDERMINED THE CONSTITUTION OR THREATENED DEMOCRACY
THE PRESIDENT IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH OF AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE AS IS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
IN FACT HE AND THE VICE PRESIDENT ARE THE ONLY OFFICIALS ELECTED BY THE WHOLE NATION
STANLEY NABI EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF BESSEMER SAID THEY'RE NOT REDUCING THEIR OFFER IF YOU CALCULATE THE OFFER'S VALUE AS OF THURSDAY'S CLOSE
I FIGURE IT WAS WORTH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON THURSDAY
WITH FRIDAY'S REVISION IT'S WORTH SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
THE REVISED TERMS ARE NO LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL TERMS IN THE POST CRASH MARKET

S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
I WAS SHOCKED SAYS MR. KUHLENSCHMIDT
I SAID THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE
I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY STARTED SELLING TIES IN SIZES
BUT I LOOKED AND THERE WASN'T A SIZE ON IT
MR. KINNEAR CONCEDES THAT TEXACO IS BEING BATTERED BY ITS PENNZOIL DIFFICULTIES
LEGAL EXPENSES ARE MONSTROUS
FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY IS REDUCED TO THE POINT WHERE TEXACO CAN'T FIX A MAJOR WEAKNESS DWINDLING OIL SUPPLIES
THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GOING AND ENDURES INCREASED BORROWING COSTS MR. KINNEAR SAYS
MAJOR BANKS THAT ONCE WERE EAGER TO DO BUSINESS NOW AREN'T
TO RAISE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR INSTANCE THE STOCK OF SOME *SUBSIDIARIES* HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO BANKS
BUT IF TEXACO SPENDS THAT MONEY BANK LIENS AUTOMATICALLY WILL BE PLACED ON SOME TEXACO ASSETS SAYS RICHARD BRINKMAN CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. *ROTHSCHILD* UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON

THE TREASURY RULES HOWEVER CONTAIN MODIFICATIONS OF THE S. E. C. RULES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE PROTECTION OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
IN SUCH AGREEMENTS CALLED REPOS ONE PARTY SELLS GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TO ANOTHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SELLER WILL REPURCHASE THEM AT A SPECIFIED PRICE
THE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS WOULD APPLY TO GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKERS OR DEALERS THAT ARE ALREADY REGISTERED AS WELL AS TO THE NEWLY REGISTERED ENTITIES

WITH LESS REGULATORY AND POLITICAL PRESSURE CONRAIL WAS ABLE TO ABANDON ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF TRACK BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

PRESIDENT HUSSEIN'S DOMESTIC STRATEGY AIMED AT SAVING HIS OWN SKIN HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL
*AYATOLLAH* KHOMEINI WANTS IRAQIS TO GIVE HIM MR. HUSSEIN'S HEAD AND END THE WAR

ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
